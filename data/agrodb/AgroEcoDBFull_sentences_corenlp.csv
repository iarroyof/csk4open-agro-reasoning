MX19970045827,Agroecology and biotechnology have sometimes been presented as opposing and mutually exclusive paradigms.
MX19970045827,"Here were challenge this view , arguing that the real issues have been blurred in this debate by entangling philosophical and political opinions with scientific criteria."
MX19970045827,"By separating out the different elements in the discussion , we attempt to show that in fact these two paradigms have complementary roles to play in working towards the development of a more sustainable model of agriculture , so urgently required if global food requirements are to be met without jeopardizing the quality of the environment.While recognizing the sound principles on which the agroecological approach is based , we question its capacity to adequately meet the social , economic and food demands facing the rural sector today."
MX19970045827,"Plan biotechnology , on the other hand , is presented here as an expensive but powerful tool for enhancing ( not substitute ) plant breeding."
MX19970045827,It is also shown to hold the promise of greatly reducing agriculture 's need for pesticides and other high - energy inputs.
MX19970045827,"Rather than ignore this technological package , as some of the agroecologist propose , we conclude that plant biotechnology is one of many tools modern agriculture will have to incorporate if it is to successfully meet the 21 st century 's dual challenge of higher productivity and long term sustainability."
PL9300846,The effect of soil compaction simulated by repeated passes of heavy tractor during tillage prior to seed bed preparation on the yield and yield - determining components of spring barley and oat crop was studied in the years 1985 - 87 on orthic luvisol soil.

PH9510721,"A field experiment was conducted at the experimental farm of the International Rice research Institute [ Los Banos , Laguna , Philippines ]."
PH9510721,"Four rice ( Oryza sativa L. ) genotypes - N22 , IR52 , IR20 , and IR46 - were sown on three different dates from 15 January to 4 March 1990 at an interval of 23 days."
PH9510721,Half of the experimental plots were subjected to high temperature using open - top plastic chambers at 30 days after transplanting to investigate temperature response of gas exchange traits.
PH9510721,"A phytotron experiment with the same genotypes using four day / night temperature regimes - 29/21 , 33/25 , 37/29 , and 41/33 deg C - was conducted for the same purpose."
PH9510721,Chambers increased temperature by an average of 1.3 deg C throughout the experimental period.
PH9510721,Maximum air temperature increased from 29 deg C in January to 33 deg C in May which was much lower than the highest temperature treatment in the phytotron.
PH9510721,Increased temperature by the chamber and planting date reduced lead conductance and transpiration rate of N22 and IR52 but increased leaf and canopy temperature of both genotypes compared to IR46 and IR20.
PH9510721,"In the phytotron , temperatures above 33/25 deg C increased net assimilation rate of all genotypes , but reduced intercellular CO2 , leaf conductance , and transpiration rate."
PH9510721,"At 41/33 deg C , transpiration rate , leaf conductance , and intercellular CO2 were greater for N22 than for the other genotypes."
PH9510721,These differences contributed to the tolerance of N22 to high temperaturestress
PH9510722,"Three maize cultivars , PIONEER 6181 , IPB Var 1 , and SMC305 ; three sorghum cultivars , COSOR 3 , UPL SG5 , and CS110 ; and IR43 rice were grown on dryland field to compare their grain yields and nutrient uptake."
PH9510722,Seeding dates of cultivars were staggered to synchronize flowering.
PH9510722,"For maize , 0 , 75 , 150 , 225 , and 300 kg N / ha were applied ; for sorghum 0 , 50 , 100 , 150 , and 200 kg N / ha ; and for rice , 0 , 80 , 100 and 120 kg N / ha."
PH9510722,Two hundred twenty five kilogram N per hectare gave the maximum yield for maize and 150 kg N / ha for sorghum.
PH9510722,Nitrogen rates higher than these decreased grain yields of both crops.
PH9510722,One hundred twenty kilogram N per hectare ( highest level used for rice ) gave the highest rice yield.
PH9510722,"High amounts of N applied were associated with high N concentration in maize and sorghum , but not in rice."
PH9510722,"At high N level , P concentration of stover , straw , and cob decreased but P content of grains was not affected , except in sorghum."
PH9510722,Potassium concentration in stover and straw increased with increase in N level applied while that of grain was not affected.

PH9511531,"Baseline surveys at IRRI 's key research site for acid upland rice - based farming systems in Claveria , Mindanao [ Philippines ] , indicated that upland rice - based patterns were less widespread than maize - based patterns."
PH9511531,"This was attributed to a number of unique constraints associated with upland rice production , including late - maturing cultivars that prevented production of a succeeding crop."
PH9511531,Cultivar evaluations of elite upland rice breeding materials were conducted to identify promising cultivars adapted to the acidic ( pH5 .0 ) and infertile soil conditions typical of farming systems in the majority of upland areas.
PH9511531,Heavy emphasis was on early - maturing cultivars to increase total system productivity by making it feasible for upland farmers to grow sequences of 2 - 3 crops per year.
PH9511531,A tiered system of cultivar evaluations was carried out for 5 years.
PH9511531,"IR30716 - B -1-B-1-2 , IR3880 -2-3 , IR47686 -6-2-2-1 and IR12979 -24-1 ( Brown ) were outstanding in consistency in yield across years , outperforming the released variety UPL Ri - 5 , and local varieties Dinorado , Speaker and Kayatan."
PH9511531,Tests under farmer management in rice - maize patterns confirmed these results.
PH9511531,The use of early - maturing and high yielding upland rice varieties significantly increased the total system productivity of upland rice - based patterns by promoting much higher yields of a following maizecrop
PH19970059593,"A major effect has been initiated at IRRI [ International Rice Research Inst. , Los Banos , Laguna , Philippines ] to develop a new plant type to break through the yield ceiling."
PH19970059593,"The new plant type is characterized by large panicles , high spikelet number per panicle , regulated tillering habit , sturdy stems , dark green and erect leaves , and a growth duration of 110 to 120 days."
PH19970059593,These traits are needed to increase sink size and assimilate supply and to avoid losses from unproductive tillers.
PH19970059593,It is important to know how stable the tillering of the new plant types are under different population densities and nitrogen levels so that the plant breeders can have a selection range and the agronomists the bases for adjusting the N management for the new plant types.
PH19970059593,"In 1993 WS [ wet season ] , eight early - generation new plant type lines were evaluated and compared with IR72 for tillering stability at four spacings : 10 x 10 , 15 x 15 , 20 x 20 , and 25 x 25 cm and two nitrogen levels : 60 and 100 kg N / ha."
PH19970059593,"At 25 x 25 cm spacing , the high - tillering IR72 had three time more tillers than the low - tillering new plant types regardless of N levels."
PH19970059593,The low tillering habit of the new plant type was expressed across plant densities and N levels.
PH19970059593,"In 1994 DS [ dry season ] , other morphological traits and yield potential of new plant type lines were evaluated using both transplanted and direct - seeded crop establishment."
SK19970093015,"Using a new field method , crop yield response to soil moisture deficiency during the extreme - critical and important stages of maize ontogenesis is established."
SK19970093015,The differential and total coefficients of maize susceptibility to soil moisture deficiency during these stages are calculated.
SK19970093015,Dependence of the grain yield reduction on lowerings of the soil - moisture energy level during the extreme - critical stage was discovered to be strong.
SK19970093015,All results are of prime significance to the precise and multivariant management of soil water status and grain production.
PH19970076379,Rainfed lowland rice response to applied fertilizer is often poor.
PH19970076379,The advantage of applying fertilizer nutrients to a pre-rice manure crop ( Sesbania rostrata ) to enhance nutrient availability was evaluated in experiments at six sites in Northeast Thailand from 1987 to 1991.
PH19970076379,At all sites treatments were arranged in split - plot design with three replicates.
PH19970076379,"Main plots were nutrient sources for the pre-rice crop ( Sesbania , Sesbania + 13 kg P / ha , Sesbania + 3 t / ha farmyard manure ( FYM ) , fallow ) and subplots were nutrient levels for wet season rice crop ( 0 , 50 kg N / ha + 13 kg P + 25 kg K / ha , 3 t / ha FYM )."
PH19970076379,"This paper examined the relationship between rice yields and N , P , and K uptake."
PH19970076379,"Generally , rice grain yield was linearly related to N - uptake over sites and years ( R raised to the 2nd power = 0.75 ** , except at Khon Kaen in 1987 and at Ubon in 1990."
PH19970076379,"There were no exceptions , however , for the linear relationship between DM and N uptake ( R raised to the 2nd power = 0.67 ** ) indicating that drought stress during reproductive growth limited grain yield."
PH19970076379,The relationship between grain yield and P uptake was not consistent over years.
PH19970076379,Uptake of K was not closely related to grain yield or total rice dry matter.
PH19970076379,Those relationships will be use to estimate the N and P balance and N and P uptake efficiency.

PL9600217,Pesticide application is indispensible for obtaining high yield.
PL9600217,On 12 various cultures in the considerably higher yields were obtained on the field intensively protected with pesticides than on the field applying more expensive agrotechnical treatments.
PL9600217,"The pesticide penetration to various components of biocenosis : the soil , water and agricultural products areanalysed"
PH9510046,The root traits that confer drought resistance are not well defined.
PH9510046,Glasshouse research has shown that the root xylem vessel cross-sectional area does not explain water relation differences across genotypes.
PH9510046,"In field experiments under upland conditions , root length density ( RLD ) was negatively correlated with grain yield of three rice genotypes grown under different levels of water deficit stress."
PH9510046,"On the other hand , in minirhizotron experiments under rainfed lowland conditions , only RLD in the 10 - 20 and 20 - 30 cm soil layers were related to relative yields ( 30 - d vegetative phase stress yield / continuously flooded control yield ) in 12 rainfed lowland genotypes and only on 2 sampling days ( 86 and 89 d after sowing )."
PH9510046,Two root characteristics were common to drought - resistant rainfed lowland genotypes : 1 .)
PH9510046,"rapid root responses to changing soil moisture level in the 10 - 20 and 20 - 30 cm soil layers , and 2 ) greater absolute RLD below 20cm"
PH9510031,Yield loss models have been developed and evaluated for irrigated rice ecosystems with respects to effects of Echinochloa crus - galli.
PH9510031,Simple regression models that give the relation between yield loss and weed density or related leaf area are discussed with respect to their practical value in weed management in rice.
PH9510031,More complex eco-physiological process models have been developed and used for rice ecosystems as well.
PH9510031,"Such models can be useful as a tool in research , whereas more simple approaches are needed for practical application in weedmanagement"
PH9510032,Natural enemies that have caused major damage to some weeds in the Philippines are reported in this paper.
PH9510032,It may be possible to control specific weed species by manipulating their natural enemies.
PH9510032,"Even though some of the natural enemies appear to have considerable promise as biocontrol agents , much research is needed to determine , among other things , their efficacy and their host range before they can be recommended for use."
PH9510032,Some of the advantages and disadvantages of biological control are discussed and the need to use biological weed control as one of the tools in a total weed management package isstressed

NL9502127,"MacKey ) germplasm was evaluated in nutrient solutions containing 0 , 74 or 148 Î 1/4 M of total Al.."
NL9502127,Relative root length ( 148 Î 1/4 M Al / 0 Al ) of various genotypes ranged from 41 to 72 % ( from moderately sensitive to moderately tolerant to Al ).
NL9502127,No genotype with Al tolerance close to that of very tolerant T. aestivum cultivar Atlas - 66 was found.
NL9502127,Such a significant correlation was not obtained for seed concentrations of other nutrients or seed protein content.
NL9502549,There is potential in tropical regions to include cowpea ( Vigna unguiculata ( L. ) Walp .)
NL9502549,"in rice ( Oryza sativa ) based cropping systems , especially during the post-monsoonal dry season."
NL9502549,"The plant water relations , and root and shoot growth of two cowpea cultivars ( IT82D - 889 , early maturing , and TVX1948 - 012F , medium maturing ) were compared in saturated and drier soil moisture regimes on an isohyperthermic , clayey , Typic Tropudalf soil by using a line - source sprinkler differential irrigation system."
NL9502549,"Saturated soil reduced total dry matter accumulation , plant height , crop growth rate and leaf area index by 20 to 50 % , 7 to 10 % , 20 to 50 % and 20 to 30 % , respectively."
NL9502549,"Root length density ( RLD ) measurements showed that in saturated soil , roots of both cultivars were concentrated in the top 0.1 m during the vegetative stage , but in the reproductive stage , grew down to 0.8 m. Leaf water potential ( LWP ) was higher by 0.3 MPa , and conductances were higher by 5 to 29 % in dry than saturated soil."
NL9502549,"The cultivar TVX1948 - 012F had greater RLD , conductance and LWP than did with IT82D - 889 under saturated conditions."
NL9502549,Results suggest that the medium - maturing cultivar is better adapted than the early - maturing to high rainfall and high water table conditions in the post-rice environment.
NL9502549,Its shallow rooting under saturated soil conditions enables more effective oxygen uptake in the vegetative growth phase.
NL9502549,Deep rooting provides for effective water uptake and increased plant water status under subsequent drought conditions in the reproductive growth phase.
NL9502352,Atmospheric CO2 is expected to exceed 600 Î 1/4 l 1âˆ ’ 1 by the 21st century and is predicted to increase global mean temperature by 0â € “ 8Â °C.
NL9502352,"Because CO2 and temperature are expected to increase together , we conducted controlled - environment chamber research to assess the effects of two CO2 concentrations ( 330 and 660 Î 1/4 l 1âˆ ’ 1 ) and three temperature regimes ( 29/21 , 33/25 , 37 / 29Â °C , day / night temperature ) on three lowland ( IR28 , IR36 , IR64 ) and three upland ( ITA186 , Moroberekan , Salumpikit ) rice cultivars."
NL9502352,"At 330 Î 1/4 l lâˆ ’ 1 CO2 , most cultivars grew best at 33 / 25Â °C."
NL9502352,"Doubling CO2 increased plant height by 17 % at 29 / 21Â °C and by 7 % at 33 / 25Â °C , but reduced plant height by 3 % at 37 / 29Â °C."
NL9502352,"Increasing temperature from 29/21 to 37 / 29Â °C reduced tiller number by 10 % but doubling CO2 more than offset this effect so that tiller number was 66 % greater in the high CO2 , high temperature treatment than in the low CO2 , low temperature treatment at 45 days after sowing."
NL9502352,"In the lowland cultivars the combination of higher CO2 and higher temperaure doubly shortened the vegetative and reproductive phase , while at 29 / 21Â °C , increased CO2 delayed onset of the reproductive phase."
NL9502352,"At 29 / 21Â °C , doubling CO2 increased time to flowering by 6 % but at 37 / 29Â °C , doubling CO2 decreased time to flowering by 6 %."
NL9502352,Flowering of ITA 186 was not affected by CO2 level.
NL9502352,Doubling CO2 increased total dry weight at flowering by 22 %.
NL9502352,Total dry weight was inversely related to high temperature for the lowland cultivars.
NL9502352,"Although controlled - environment experiments have their drawbacks , the present data indicate varietal differences in responses to CO2 and temperature and a significant interactive effects of CO2 and temperature on development of lowland rices."
NL9502352,These differences may provide options to minimise adverse effects of future climate changes.
GB9608062,Phytotron studies were conducted to determine the intraspecific variation in sensitivity of rice ( Oryza sativa L. ) to enhanced UVB and to test the hypothesis that rice cultivars originating from regions with higher ambient UVB radiation are more tolerant to enhanced UVB.
GB9608062,"Out of the 188 rice cultivars ( from various rice growing regions and ecosystems ) tested , 143 had significantly reduced plant height , 52 had smaller leaf area , 61 had lower plant dry weight and 41 had less tiller number under elevated UVB radiation ( 13.0 kJ mâˆ ’ 2 dayâˆ ’ 1 ) for 3 weeks."
GB9608062,"Six cultivars showed significant positive growth response to enhanced UVB radiation , although the mechanism is not clear at present."
GB9608062,These six cultivars were from the summer rice crop of Bangladesh and from high elevation rice areas where prevailing UVB radiation is most likely to be greater.
GB9608062,"However , there was no correlation between the dry matter changes under enhanced UVB and the ambient UVB level at the origin of the cultivar across the 188 cultivars tested."
GB9608062,"Therefore , cultivars originating from regions with higher ambient UVB are not necessarily more tolerant to enhanced UVB radiation."
GB9602283,To what extent some microbial index ratios are suitable for use as early criteria for the level of compost stability during aerobic composting of coniferous sawdust and bark at mesophilic conditions was studied.
GB9602283,Evolution of the specific respiration activity ( CO2 - C / biomass C ) and the ratios between some groups of microorganisms were followed as a function of composting time.
GB9602283,The specific respiration activity was found to be an early and most reliable indicator of compost stability.
GB9602283,"The peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase enzyme activity during composting , as well as the composition of newly - formed humus substances were studied."
GB9602283,The duration of composting increased the quality of newly - formed humus substances ( Ch.a. : Cf.a ratio ; Ca - complexed humic acid and resistance of organo - mineral complexes ).
GB9602283,The quality of humus substances could be used to assess compost stability.
GB9602283,"However , the results can be applied only under defined conditions."
PH9610806,An experiment was conducted in 1993 dry season to separate the effects of seedling competition in the nursery from transplanting shock on the rice crop.
PH9610806,"Ten , 20 , 30 , and 40 - day old seedlings of IR72 and IR58109 -113-3-3-2 were grown by staggered sowing in wet beds ( WB ) at 100 grams seeds / sq. m. and in wet beds in hills ( HWB ) at 20 cm x 20 cm spacing with five seeds / hill."
PH9610806,Each seedling age had a corresponding direct sowing ( DS ) in hills with the same spacing and population as HWB.
PH9610806,"Competition effects and transplanting shock effects were expressed as the difference of WB from HWB and DS from HWB , respectively."
PH9610806,"Competition suppressed tillering and caused tiller degeneration in the seedbed , thus , reducing tillers by 55 to 64 percent at 30 DAS , and leaf area index by 25 to 40 percent and total dry weight by 14 to 27 percent starting at 20 DAS."
PH9610806,Prolonged period in the seedbed aggravated these effects.
PH9610806,Transplanting shock in 20 - day old seedlings delayed flowering by 6 to 7 days.
PH9610806,Competition delayed flowering of 30 to 40 - day old seedlings by 4 to 10 days.
PH9610806,Panicle yield declined by 0.95 t / ha due to transplanting shock and by 0.87 t / ha due to competition in the 20 - day old IR71 seedlings.
PH9610806,The overall effects of competition and transplanting shock were not apparent with the 10 - day old seedlings but were prominent with older seedlings.
PH9610766,Field experiments were conducted in RCBD with 4 replications in the 1993 dry season to relate grain filling characters with yield.
PH9610766,Panicle dry weights and stem carbohydrates of six rice cultivars were determined at 4 - day intervals for 40 days starting at flowering.
PH9610766,"The grain filling duration was divided into lag , linear and plateau phases."
PH9610766,Grain filling duration ranged from 19 to 32 days.
PH9610766,"IR62398 - Ac 201 - 2 , IR64616H and BG90 - 2 yielded 8.5 to 9.0 t / ha."
PH9610766,These cultivars had synchronized flowering.
PH9610766,The rate of grain filling proceeded rapidly after flowering and then gradually declined.
PH9610766,"Spikelet number ranged from 44,000 to 48,000 sq. m. IR72 , IR54 and BG276 - 5 yielded 6 to 8 t / ha."
PH9610766,"Duration of the lag and linear phases were 6 to 21 days , respectively."
PH9610766,"The number of spikelets was 40,000 sq. m. Average percentage of filled spikelets for all cultivars was 70 percent."
PH9610766,Grain yield was positively correlated with grain number and grain filling rate.
PH9610766,Maximum panicle weight was negatively correlated with the length of the lag phase and positively correlated with the grain filling duration.
PH9610766,Cultivars with synchronized flowering of tillers have high yield potential.
PH9610684,Wet seeding has become popular in Southeast Asia because it is cheaper than transplanting.
PH9610684,"Although several studies reported that wet seeded rice ( WSR ) yielded higher than transplanted rice ( TPR ) , most of these studies were conducted at low yield level using high tillering cultivars and no comprehensive physiological bases supported these findings."
PH9610684,"This study compared the growth characteristics , N - use efficiency , yield components , and yield of WSR and TPR using moderate ( IR60819 -34-2-1 ) and high tillering ( IR72 ) cultivars at two field sites during the 1993 dry ( DS ) and wet ( WS ) seasons."
PH9610684,Seeding rate for WSR was 150 kg / ha for DS and 100 kg / ha for WS.
PH9610684,Five 14 - day old seedlings per hill were transplanted at 20 x 20 cm spacing for TPR.
PH9610684,"Wet seeded rice reached panicle initiation , flowering , and physiological maturity one week earlier than TPR."
PH9610684,"Because it did not experience transplanting shock , WSR developed leaf area , biomass , and took up N faster than did TPR but showed no significant yield advantage over TPR."
PH9610684,"Under lodging condition , WSR yielded significantly lower than TPR."
PH9610684,"Irrespective of cultivar , WSR does not have any yield advantage over TPR."
QR19970086874,Crop - animal integrated systems have been an important Chinese heritage and are regarded as a major component of organic agriculture.
QR19970086874,"In recent years , research based on traditional crop and animal science was integrated , then , converged with agroecology to develop into the new field of crop - animal integrated systems research."
QR19970086874,"Up to now , the priorities were rice - based , crop - hog and crop - dairy systems."
QR19970086874,"Research results of crop - animal integrated systems showed that integrating triticale as a forage crop into the rice mono - cropping ( in temperate zone ) , or maize as a silage crop into the barley - rice double cropping ( in subtropical zones ) provided good forage sources for dairy cattle with no reduction in rice yield."
QR19970086874,Rice cropping on the upper terraced wetland under insufficient irrigation ( in subtropical zone ) gave equal yield but higher profit.
QR19970086874,The maize crop benefited both the hog and dairy production systems through maize grains and stalks.
QR19970086874,These interventions have been implemented in the production system and have made impact.
QR19970086874,"The methodology also included the assessment of the effectiveness and feasibility of improved technology by marginal benefit over cost index ; introduced indices for evaluating systematic productivity , property stability , sustainability , equality , and diversity ; monitoring energy use , efficiency and nutrient equilibrium , and analysis based on the input and output of energy and major nutrients."
QR19970086874,"To indicate the resource - food - human status , an expression of human - carrying capacity is formulated."
QR19970086874,"Future research will be directed to sustainable farming systems with emphasis on continuing effort to diversify farming structure for higher profits ; rehabilitating organic farming by new ways for higher profits ; selection of multipurpose crops which can satisfy the food , feed , fertility , and cash requirements."
PH19970137866,"Seasonal patterns of soil extractable inorganic N ( EIN ) , extractable organic N ( EON ) , soluble sugars ( SS ) , total carbohydrates ( T Cbh ) and crop N uptake were compared in rice - rice and rice - maize systems at IRRI."
PH19970137866,"These parameters were examined in the 1994 dry season in maize and rice main plots with N rate subplots of 0 , 95 , or 190 kg N / ha ( N0 , N95 , N190 )."
PH19970137866,There were large differences in N and C dynamics due to cropping system.
PH19970137866,Fertilizer N rates had little effect on EIN and EON in rice plots.
PH19970137866,"Regardless of N rate , EIN ( mostly NH4 + - N ) ranged from 12 kg N / ha at transplanting , to a maximum of 23 kg N / ha at 18 days after transplanting ( DT ) and decreased to 4 kg N / ha at 67 DT ( flowering )."
PH19970137866,"Similarly , EON was 13 N / ha at transplanting then decreased to 6 kg N / ha at 67 DT."
PH19970137866,"In the maize plots , N rate had a large impact in EIN ( mostly N03 - - N ) and EON."
PH19970137866,"Likewise , EON was 50 percent greater at flowering in N 190 ( 21 kg N / ha ) than in N0 ( 11 kg N / ha ) , but similar in both treatments before flowering."
PH19970137866,"N rate did not affect TCbh in either rice or maize system , although higher TCbh was observed in maize ( 1230 kg C / ha ) than in rice ( 1100 kg C / ha )."
PH19970137866,Neither cropping systems nor N rate influenced SS content.
PH19970137866,Rice grain yield increased from 4.2 t / ha in N0 treatments to 8.5 t / ha with N 190.
PH19970137866,Maize grain yields were 2.2 t / ha at N0 and 7.0 t / ha at N 190.
PH19970137866,"At maturity , N accumulation was 49 kg N / ha for both rice and maize in N0 treatments."
PH19970137866,"In N 190 treatments , N accumulation increased to 148 kg N / ha in rice , representing a recovery efficiency of 52 percent ; maize N accumulation was 177 kg N / ha , for a recovery efficiency of 67 percent."
PH19970137866,"These results suggest that the increased fertilizer use efficiency by maize reflected greater retention of applied N in EIN and EON pools throughout the growing season , and particularly in the period of greatest crop demand."
PH19970062320,Rice plants of the future are aimed at yields 12 - 15 t / ha in tropical regions to support population growth and loss of irrigated lands to industrialization.
PH19970062320,"New plant types require greater light interception , more C and N assimilation and greater tolerance to lodging."
PH19970062320,"Current cultivars have two major weaknesses : 1 ) almost all the leaves supplying carbohydrates are beneath the panicles in the shade , and 2 ) panicles are at the top resulting in a high center of gravity and lodging susceptibility."
PH19970062320,A simple solution to both problems is to lower panicle height in the canopy.
PH19970062320,"This study investigates the impact of lowering panicle height on 1 ) canopy photosynthesis by removing panicles to simulate low panicle height , and 2 ) lodging susceptibility by calculating rotational inertia ( I ) based on plant biomass."
PH19970062320,"When panicles were removed , irradiance below the panicle layer increased 52 - 80 percent and canopy photosynthesis increased 42 - 52 percent."
PH19970062320,Canopy photosynthesis increased because of greater light interception since neither canopy dark respiration nor single leaf photosynthesis changed significantly after panicle removal.
PH19970062320,"These observations support the physiological model for light competition , INTERCOM , which predicts 25 and 40 percent increases in canopy photosynthesis by lowering panicles from 90 percent to 35 percent of canopy height at yields of 10 and 15t / ha , respectively."
PH19970062320,Increasing yield from 10 to 15 t / ha increased lodging susceptibility by 32 percent but this could be eliminated by reducing panicle height from 65 to 50 cm at constant canopy height.
CN9681236,"The allelopathic effects of Bidens pilosa aqueous extracts in different months within a year on seed germination and seedling growth of radish , rice and cucumber were tested."

PH9511132,"Improvement of the production system for sweetpotato by using improved varieties and biofertilizer such as N - fixing bacteria , e.g. Azospirillum sp , is important especially for small farmers who can only afford low - input technologies."
PH9511132,The objective of this experiment was to study the response of two sweetpotato clones to inoculation with two isolates of an N - fixing bacteria ( Azospirillum sp. ) under two levels of soil N.
PH9511132,"An on - farm trial was conducted at Cilimus , Kuningan during dry season 1993 using a split - split plot design with 4 replications."

PH9511132,N fertilizer application significantly increased vine weight of the two clones tested.
PH9511132,Azospirillum spp. significantly increased root weight of local variety Jitok and improved the N status of the two clones tested especially at low N soil status.
PH9511132,"Under Kuningan agroecology , the productivity of promising clone BIS 183 was higher than the local varietyJitok"

GB9608063,"Ultraviolet - B ( UVB , wavelength 280 - 320 nm ) radiation has been demonstrated to affect growth and development of many plants."
GB9608063,This study was conducted to determine the effect of UVB radiation on stomatal density and opening of Oryza sativa and to test if the stomatal response to UVB was associated with different sensitivity of growth to UVB in four cultivars.
GB9608063,"Ten - day - old seedlings of IR45 and IR74 ( UVB sensitive ) , and IR64 and IR30 ( UVB less sensitive ) , were subjected to UVB radiation in a glasshouse for 6 h d - 1 for 4 weeks."
GB9608063,The unweighted UVB radiation was 1Â · 94 W m - 2 for UVB treatment and 0Â · 15 W m - 2 for control.
GB9608063,Leaf area and plant dry mass were determined every 2 weeks while stomatal density and opening were recorded weekly.
GB9608063,"Results showed that a 2 - week UVB treatment had no effect on the leaf area or plant dry mass of any test cultivar , but significantly reduced stomatal density and opening in IR45 and IR74."
GB9608063,"Under 4 - week UVB exposure , leaf area and plant dry mass of IR45 and IR74 were significantly reduced."
GB9608063,"Stomatal density decreased in all cultivars , except in IR64."
GB9608063,Greater reduction of stomata on the adaxial surface than on the abaxial surface under 3 and 4 weeks of UVB exposure suggests a direct effect of UVB radiation on stomata.
GB9608063,"IR45 and IR74 showed significant reductions in stomatal opening after 2 weeks of exposure to UVB , while stomatal opening in IR30 and IR64 decreased significantly after only 4 weeks of UVB treatment."
GB9608063,Difference in plant dry mass between UVB treated and control plants was significantly correlated with the reductions in stomatal opening and density on adaxial surface under UVB treatment.
GB9608063,"Thus , reduction in dry mass of rice plants under UVB in the glasshouse could be attributed to decrease in stomatal density and opening."
IT9661310,"Integration of agricultural and ecological sciences into the new bridge - science of agroecology is considered by the author as the most urgent , cultural and scientific need to challenge the maintanance of substainability in agriculture and to minimize environmental damage."
IT9661310,The relationship between ecology and agronomy is analysed to provide understanding of how the two areas have been evolving.
IT9661310,"Agronomy and ecology have , in the past , focused on narrow issues , agronomy mainly on crop production and ecology mainly on environmental protection."
IT9661310,"However , the latest developments in the rationales of the two disciplines concerning environmental agronomy and ecosystem ecology , respectively , have converged towards the unifying concept of agroecosystem and the new model of sustainable agriculture."
IT9661310,Agroecosystem is the key word in the process of blending ecology with agronomy and in re-orientating agricultural design and practices.

GB9615072,"Global food security in the future will depend on growth in production in those areas of the world with favourable soils , adequate water resources , and high yields from wheat and rice cropping."
GB9615072,"Because the area devoted to rice and wheat cultivation in these favourable conditions has been stagnant or declining since the 1980s , with little prospect for reversing the trend , increases in grain production must come from increases in yield per hectare."
GB9615072,"To achieve the needed increases in yields of basic food grains , a broad range of constraints facing existing production systems must be removed."
GB9615072,"Additional inputs for crop production are needed , and new technologies , which have yet to be developed , are essential for managing crop nutrients , pests and diseases."
GB9615072,"Under normal economic conditions , optimal farm management of high - intensity agriculture produces grain yields that approach 80 % of the technical ceiling achieved on experimental plots."
GB9615072,"As Asian farmers approach this 80 % limit , pushing out the technical yield ceiling will be crucial for maintaining growth in cereal yields into the 21st Century."
GB9615072,"If management practices focus on short - run profitability rather than on long - run sustainability , the challenge to scientists seeking to raise yield potential becomes more complex because of the deteriorating soil environment in which crops are grown."
GB9615072,Most of the agricultural land in the developing world has less - favourable endowments of soil and water resources than do the high - productivity farming areas of Asia.
GB9615072,These regions are home to the majority of the world 's poor.
GB9615072,Developments in production ecology suggest that significant improvement is possible in the management of biological processes that govern the efficiency and sustainability of the agricultural systems that dominate in these poorly endowed areas.
GB9615072,But a substantial investment in research for crop production will be required.

ID2000000318,"Package of technology for groundnut production on specific agroecology had not been available , so that general technology recommendation applies to all environments."
ID2000000318,"Technology identification for improving groundnut production on dry lands in Tuban area ( East Java ) was attempted by applying "" On Farm Adaptive Research "" method."
ID2000000318,"Research activities involve reserchers , extension agents , and farmers , for all steps of the research processes , and were carried out in Tuban district from 1991 to 1995."
ID2000000318,"Through the research process , a package of technology was identified , containing ( 1 ) selected local groundnut variety , ( 2 ) high quality of seeds for planting , ( 3 ) land preparation by deep ploughing ( 25 cm ) , ( 4 ) fertilization at rate of 50 kg Urea + 75 kg TSP + 50 kg KCl per ha + 2000 kg manure per ha , ( 5 ) weeding and hilling up , ( 6 ) pest control , especially for thrips , red mite , empoasca , leaf feeding insects ( 7 ) rust and leaf spot control using fungicide Topsin - M at 7 and 9 weeks after planting , ( 8 ) harvest at 96 to 98 days after pod planting."

ET19970126922,"Among nine species of oil crops cultivated in the country , noug ( Guzotia abyssinca ) , linseed ( Linum usitatissimum ) , Ethiopian mustard locally known as high - elevation areas and thus are known as highland oil crops."
ET19970126922,Growing nearly high - elevation areas and thus are known as highland oil crops.
ET19970126922,"Growing nearly in all regions of the country , these four species account for about 90 percent of the total area and production of oil crops in the country."
ET19970126922,"Oil crops growing in the country , are used for quite a number of purposes ; the in - be all and end - all uses include : they are sources of concentrated caloric energy , raw materials for agro-industries and are source of cash for the farmers and foreign exchange earnings for the country."
ET19970126922,"However , there is a long - standing shortage of oil crops mainly due to extremely low productivity and oscillating cultivated land."
ET19970126922,Oilseeds are predominantly produced by the resource - poor small - holding farmers using unimproved and traditional production technologies.
ET19970126922,Researches done on the highland oilseeds in Ethiopia have been achieved substantial breakthroughs.
ET19970126922,"Four noug , five linseed , six gomenzer and three rapeseed , varieties were released along with their production packages."
ET19970126922,Research feed back with respect to economics and performance of the improved technologies under the actual farm conditions have been assessed.
PH19970061816,"Eight varieties ( CT 9993 , IR52561 , IR58821 , IR62266 , KDML 105 , Mahsuri , Namsagui , IR20 ) were subjected to two water regimes in a split - plot design where water regimes were assigned as the main plots and the varieties as the subplots."
PH19970061816,"In well - watered treatments , pots were continuously watered , while in stress treatments , water was withheld from panicle initiation ( PI ) until leaf rolling scores of 5 were attained , then pots were rewatered."
PH19970061816,Plantings were staggered in order that PI among varieties coincide.
PH19970061816,"With water deficits root length density ( RLD ) was similar to well - watered in surface layers , was reduced at 10 - 20 and 20 - 30 cm depths , and was greater at 30 - 40 and 40 - 50 cm depths."
PH19970061816,A similar pattern was observed for root mass density ( RMD ).
PH19970061816,"Root thickness ( RT ) was less at 5 - 10 , 10 - 20 , and 20 - 30 cm soil depths but was substantially more at 40 - 50 cm soil depth."
PH19970061816,"Because of the severity of the drought stress imposed , RLD failed to recover on rewatering , except for the earliest line ( CT 9993 )."
PH19970061816,"Transpiration partly recovered for CT9993 , KDML105 , and Namsugui , which may imply that the Thai lines ( KDML105 and Namsugui ) were able to maintain a more functional root system in these conditions."
ID1997000351,"Two sets of experiment were conducted at farmer 's field Kumbung , Pesisir Selatan , West Sumatera during dry season 1992."
ID1997000351,They were : ( 1 ) Efficacy of different selected herbicides on controlling weeds associated with broadcast - direct seeding lowland rice ; and ( 2 ) Technology of broadcast - direct seeding lowland rice within a large scale.
ID1997000351,"The former was arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications , while the later was to compare the comparative advantages of broadcast - direct seeding to transplanted lowland rice practices without any replications."
ID1997000351,Results showed that thiobencarb / 2.4 - D suppressed weeds population by 41 percent and increased the rice grain yield about 3.04 t / ha over weedy check.
ID1997000351,The other alternatives promising herbicides i.e. 2.4 - D and Butachlor may have been suggested in order to subtitute unavailable thiobencarb / 2.4 - D.
ID1997000351,A given technology within large scale reduced labors needed by 47 percent or equivalent to Rp.
ID1997000351,188.200 from total cost inputs consumed or produced 1.13 to rough rice higher than transplanted rice ( common practice by farmers ).
ID1997000351,"When all labor inputs were accounted , the technology gained net benefit about Rp."
ID1997000351,"154.750 , while transplanted practice lost around Rp."
ID1997000351,242.500.
ID1997000351,"Therefore , the technology may be suggested to disseminate to other agroecology with the conditions of labor shortage , lower cropping index , and available or reliable irrigationsystems"
CH9600193,In 1992 the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology and Agriculture evaluated various expert systems for herbicide treatments in field crops.
CH9600193,"The Danish programme "" PC Plant Protection "" was chosen for further development in Switzerland , owing to its ability to select the most appropriate herbicides and application rates to control the weeds present."
CH9600193,For the programme to work properly it is necessary to have data from field trials with reduced herbicide application.
CH9600193,The original Danish version was tested in Switzerland in 1992 and it was found that the doses could be considerably reduced with a sufficient effect being maintained.
CH9600193,"Unfortunately , the weeds and herbicides used in this computer version did not reflect the weeds and flora and approved herbicides in Switzerland."
CH9600193,Between 1993 and 1995 we tested a version adapted to Swiss conditions.
CH9600193,The missing information had to be estimated by extrapolation.
CH9600193,"Therefore , the reduction of application rates was less satisfactory with this version."
CH9600193,Since 1995 eleven European countries have been working together in an EU concerted action to further develop theprogramme
ID1999000242,The increase of income relativelly is difficult to be achieved without reorienting of traditionally farming become an agribusiness wether in a large or small scale.
ID1999000242,The basic principle of agribusiness is on the component of production of agricultural commodity and its relevant activity with other components which will control the whole performance of agribusiness.
ID1999000242,"The development of commodity production is not succeed because of no tailorring an appropriate activity for the supply of input production , marketing and yield processing."
ID1999000242,"The peanut is having high economic value and strategic because of its role for the human food and costle feed , industrial raw material , and income source for farmers."
ID1999000242,"Based on research done in some areas due its specific agroecology , the Gajah variety of peanut had broader adaptation compare to Macan , Local Gajah and local variety."
ID1999000242,"The Gajah variety had a good adaptation in Tanjung Anom and Mburuai Deli Serdang villages , Pantai Gemi Langkat village , and Sarmatondang Simalungun village."
ID1999000242,Gajah and Macan varieties produced higher yield than local variety in land having soil pH 5.5 -6.0
PH9610529,"The entries were dry seeded during wet seasons in Gerona ( 1991 ) and Victoria ( 1992 and 1993 ) , with two seeding dates in 1993."
PH9610529,"The relationship between grain yield , crop duration , and seasonal condition was examined for seven genotypes over four locations."
PH9610529,"During the favorable 1991 season , grain yield increased from 4.7 to 6.1 t / ha , as crop duration increased from 107 to 121 d ( 2050 to 2360 day - degrees )."
PH9610529,"IR 46 performed well in its maturity group under these conditions , while IR 41431 -68-1-2-3 performed poorly because of early lodging at the grain - filling stage."
PH9610529,The relationship between yield and crop duration at the other sites was unclear.
PH9610529,"Site mean yield of 4.5 , 4.9 , and 3.2 t / ha were obtained in 1992 , early 1993 , and late 1993 , respectively."
PH9610529,"Of the medium - late maturing lines subjected to moderate terminal drought in 1992 , IR 33380 -7-2-1-3 was superior."
PH9610529,"In 1993 , the early - season dry spell delayed flowering and maturity of all genotypes in the first planting , and in the late planting , crop duration was shortened and yield was depressed for all genotypes."
PH9610529,"The early - maturing line IR 54068 - B -60-1-3-3 yielded well in all of these less - favored environments , whereas IR72 performed poorly in both plantings in 1993."
PH9610529,"Results indicated that about 90 d or 1800 day - degrees to flowering was required for higher and more stable yield , which is equivalent to about 118 d or 2250 day - degrees to maturity."
PH9610516,Resin - coated nitrogen ( N ) fertilizer have been proven to improve N recovery by rice in temperate flooded systems.
PH9610516,"However , these were never tested under tropical upland field condition."
PH9610516,"In 1995 wet season , polyolefincoated urea ( POC urea ) under different basal application methods ( surface incorporation , shallow band , and deep band application ) was used in UPLRi - 5 at the upland field in IRRI."
PH9610516,"These were compared with ordinary urea using the same placement methods , ordinary urea at three equal split applications , and with no N fertilizer."
PH9610516,Tiller number ( 188 / sq m ) was similar for all treatments but POC urea applied in band produced the highest dry matter ( 966 g / sq m ).
PH9610516,No difference in grain yield was observed among all placements using POC urea and ordinary urea in band application ( 2.2 t / ha ).
PH9610516,N uptake at maturity with POC urea applied in band was comparable with that in split application with ordinary urea.
PH9610516,The results indicated that N recovery and plant growth can be improved by using controlled - release fertilizer and that band application is more effective than surface incorporation.
PH9610476,"IR72 with 98 spikelets per panicle had around 80 percent filled , 15 percent half - filled , and 5 percent unfilled spikelets , regardless of the position in the panicle."
PH9610476,IR68 284 H with 110 spikelets per panicle had more half - filled and unfilled spikelets in the middle and bottom part of the panicle than at the top.
PH9610476,IR65598 -112-2 with 226 spikelets per panicle clearly showed an increase in half - filled spikelets from the top to the bottom part of the panicle and a decrease in filled spikelets.
PH9610476,This suggests that the poor grain filling of NPT [ new plant type ] was partially due to source limitation possibly caused by early leaf senescence.
PH9610476,"To further determine the cause of poor grain filling of IR65598 -112-2 , an experiment on flag leaf and spikelet removal was conducted at the IRRI [ Los Banos , Laguna , Philippines ] farm."
PH9610476,Flag leaf removal at the start of grain filling resulted in a 13 percent decrease in filled spikelets for IR72 compared with a 44 percent decrease in IR65598 -112-2.
PH9610476,Removing half of the spikelets alternately 2 days after heading did not affect the filled spikelet percentage and grain weight of IR72 but caused a 42 percent increase in filled spikelets and an 8 percent increase in the weight grain of IR65598 -112-2.
PH9610476,"This shows that the high density of spikelets ( i.e. , spikelet number per unit panicle length ) may be one of the reasons for the poor grain filling in the NPT."
PH9610476,This is also partly supported by the negative correlation ( r = -0.49 ) between filled spikelet percentage and the spikelet number per unit cm of panicle in the 1995 DS Bulu Obervational Nursery at IRRI.
PH9610476,Grain filling of NPT may be improved by selecting plants with a low number of spikelets per unit length without reducing sink size and delaying flag leaf senescence.
RO19990039259,"A 5x8 factorial pot experiment with oat at five different soils ( Haplustolls , Calcixerolls , Vertisols , Albaqualfa , Alfisols ) and 8 increasing degree of saturation of phosphate adsorption maximum , corresponding to 6 , 12 , 25 , 50 , 100 , 150 and 200 per cent Pmax plus Control ( without P application ) , was carried out."
RO19990039259,"There were significant changes in the chemical composition of oat , depending not only on the soil type , but also on the increasing degree of saturation of Pmax of the soil."
RO19990039259,The P content was varied in large range from 220 to 600 mg / 100g DM in the grain and from 30 to 770 mg / 100g DM in the straw.
RO19990039259,There was a sharp increase in the content of P in straw in the interval 25 - 50 per cent Pmax for all investigated soils and at some soils P per cent reached and even exceeded the content of P in grain.
RO19990039259,"Significant changes in the content of other nutrients ( K , Ca , Zn , Mn , Cu ) and in the ratio between them were observed."
RO19990039259,There was not a single trend of increase or decrease of the content of the nutrients and ratios as a result of P application but secondary local maxima and minima.
RO19990039259,"Therefore , the use of the united optimising criteria to create regulated P levels at different soils is necessary not only in fertiliser application , but also in research work involving different soils."
RO1998000023,"Wheat growth simulation models constructed by a collaborative team of the Agrophysical Institute - Sanct Petersburg , Russia and Nikola Poushkarov Institute of Soil Science and Agroecology - Sofia , Bulgaria exploit the relationschip between various agrometeorological components of the water and heat balance of the system "" soil - plant - atmosphere "" of the field."
RO1998000023,The sensitivity of these models depends on the variation in the water content and temperature in the soil profile and they need objective data about these variables measured in the field.
RO1998000023,Significant steps in the direction of evaluating soil moisture and temperature based on portable electronic devices were taken by Alexieva and Ilieva ( 1991 ) who evaluated the influence of some thermal characteristics to the soil moisture.
RO1998000023,Stated differently the water and heat fluxes are relatively dependent on the wheat canopy and continuos measurement of their components is necessary.
RO1998000023,The purpose of the paper is to show an approach for easy and realiable instrumental evaluation of the main water and heat balance components in a wheat field.
ID1999000621,Expansion of salacca production will be profitable if it is applied on suitable agroecology.
ID1999000621,"Therefore identification of the characteristics of agroecology suitable for producing various salacca cultivars ( i.e. Bali , Kersikan , Bangkalan , Suwaru ) was conducted in 1995 - 1996."

QY19970115787,En el litoral atlantico de Honduras se ha documentado un sistema de aboneras con la rotacion de maiz con mucuna.
QY19970115787,"Para duplicar este sistema en otras partes , se necesita una base teorica solida."
QY19970115787,"El presente estudio intenta proveer la informacion basica sobre el sistema de aboneras , en especial la dinamica de nutrimentos."
QY19970115787,Tambien se analizan tendencias a largo plazo de la fertilidad quimica y fisica de los suelos.
QY19970115787,La metodologia se baso en estudiar parcelas con distintas historia de uso de esta rotacion con aboneras para detectar cambios a largo plazo.
QY19970115787,"Se describe brevemente el sistema de aboneras y se analizan las tracciones de la dinamica de nutrientes a lo largo del ano , la acumulacion y mineralizacion de la biomasa de mucuna , asi como la dinamica del N en el perfil del suelo."
QY19970115787,"Finalmente , un examen preliminar de los datos permite concluir que los suelos han mejorado Despues de 12 anos de rotacion continua , debido a la accion multiforme del mulch de la mucuna mantenido sobre el suelo."
QY19970115787,"Si bien este sistema de aboneras es demasiado especifico para extrapolarlo directamente a otras regiones , el mantenimiento de una cobertura casi perenne parece constituir un punto critico para lograr una buena productividad y sostenabilidad agricola."
PH1998010355,Most carbon required for yield is assimilated during grain filling in rice.
PH1998010355,Optimized canopy architecture during this stage is thus crucial for high yield potential.
PH1998010355,"During grain filling , most current cultivars have particles on the top of the canopy and suffer from the limitations : ( 1 ) leaves shaded by panicles reduce canopy photosynthesis for supplying carbohydrates to the grain , and ( 2 ) plants have a high center of gravity and are susceptible to lodging."
PH1998010355,A simple solution to both problems is to lower the panicle height in the canopy.
PH1998010355,"This study demonstrates the benefits of a new , low panicle ( LP ) rice plant type by presenting results with "" artificial panicles "" and simulation modeling."
PH1998010355,Artificial panicles are dried panicles which are attached to sticks and positioned in the canopy at different heights to evaluate effects on canopy photosynthesis.
PH1998010355,The effects of artificial panicles were most pronounced at high yield conditions at 90 and 180 kg N / ha applications.
PH1998010355,"When panicles were place at 60 percent of canopy height , canopy photosynthesis was 150 - 240 percent of rates for plants with panicles placed at 100 percent of canopy height."
PH1998010355,"Even at low yield conditions , at 0 kg N / ha there was a 32 percent increase in canopy photosynthesis for LP relative to high - panicle plants."
PH1998010355,"Modeling predicts that lowering panicles within the canopy from 90 to 40 percent canopy height will increase yield by 18 , 26 , and 41 percent at a panicle area index ( PAI ) of 0.4 , 0.6 and 1.0 respectively."
PH1998010355,"This implies that the higher the yield , the greater the benefits of LP rice."
PH1998010355,Increasing yields with LP rice will likely be more sustainable because theoretically either higher yield may be achieved at the same N application of the same yield at lower N application.
PH1998010355,"Plant breeding is now required to develop LP rice to confirm the benefits of the new , LP rice planttype"
PH1998010430,It was hypothesized that low temperature ( T ) increases panicle size ( spikelets / panicle ) by increasing the duration of panicle growth.
PH1998010430,"In this study , the effects of T on panicle size and growth duration was determined with genotypes differing in tillering capacity."
PH1998010430,"Treatments were factorial combinations of 5 genotypes ( IR72 , IR65598 -112-2 , IR68284H , Guichao 2 , and Shanyou 63 ) and 2 diurnal T regimes ( day / night : 30/25 and 25/20 deg C ) imposed at either vegetative stage ( VS ) or reproductive stage ( RS ) or both."
PH1998010430,Rice plants were grown in naturally lighted growth chambers with constant photoperiod of 12 h / d. Measurements were made on the main stem.
PH1998010430,Tillers were removed as they merged.
PH1998010430,Low T significantly increased the duration from sowing to flowering.
PH1998010430,The increase in duration ranged from 8 to 24 d across genotypes.
PH1998010430,The panicle size was increased by low T in only 3 of 5 genotypes.
PH1998010430,"The three genotypes that responded to low T in panicle size were high tillering types , while the other two were low tillering materials."
PH1998010430,The increase in panicle size by low T was not associated with the increase in the duration of panicle growth.
PH1998010430,"These results suggested that high T increases tillering and competition for assimilate among plants in high tillering genotypes , consequently reducing panicle size."
PH1998010430,It was hypothesized that low T influences panicle size by reducing tillering capacity of high tillering genotypes and panicle size of low tillering genotypes is not sensitive toT
PH1998010352,"In a dry season experiment at the Philippine Rice Research Institute in 1994 , the tiller production of IR72 , IR64 and IR59682 -132-1-1-2 were evaluated under six nitrogen treatments."
PH1998010352,Tillers were sorted into groups according to the number of leaves.
PH1998010352,"Assuming that the smallest tillers were the first to die , the biomass and leaf area of unproductive tillers at different days after transplanting ( DAT ) were calculated."
PH1998010352,"The results showed : ( 1 ) there were large numbers of unproductive tillers in all treatments the percentage of which was 25.6 - 60.8 percent , depending on cultivar and treatment."
PH1998010352,( 2 ) The proportion of biomass and leaf area in unproductive tillers increased to 23.6 percent and 29.1 percent respectively at 33 DAT and then decreased linearly until harvest.
PH1998010352,( 3 ) The relationships between stem number ( independent variable ) and biomass and leaf area were positively linear at 26 DAT and 39 DAT while parabolic at flowering.
PH1998010352,There was an optimum stem number for each cultivar to reach maximum biomass and leaf area at flowering.
PH1998010352,( 4 ) The biomass and grain yield first increased as the number of unproductive tillers increased and then decreased later.
PH1998010352,"Considering the large number of unproductive tillers and high proportion of biomass and leaf area in unproductive tillers , the contribution of unproductive tillers to grain yield should be quantified in futurestudies"
PH1998010357,The chlorophyll meter ( SPAD 502 ) is a convenient tool to estimate the leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen ( N ) content of a crop.
PH1998010357,Previous studies indicated that leaf thickness affects SPAD reading.
PH1998010357,This study aimed to determine the effect of leaf phosphorus ( P ) and potassium ( K ) concentrations on SPAD reading.
PH1998010357,"In the 1996 dry season , IR72 was grown at IRRI and PhilRice under various fertilizer levels in randomized complete block design."
PH1998010357,"At IRRI , the following fertilizer rates ( NPK kg / ha ) were used : 0 -0-0 , 0 -25-0 , 0-0-40 , 210 -0-0 , 210 -25-0 , 210 -0-40 , and 210 -25-40."
PH1998010357,"At PhilRice , NPK rates ( kg / ha ) were 0 -0-0 , 0-30-50 , 210 -0-0 , 210 -30-0 , 210 -0-50 , and 210 -30-100."
PH1998010357,"Nitrogen fertilizer was applied in four splits : before transplanting , midtillering , panicle initiation and flowering."
PH1998010357,Phosphorus and K fertilizers were applied as basal.
PH1998010357,SPAD measurements were made on the topmost fully expanded leaves at midtillering and panicle initiation.
PH1998010357,"The leaves were then detached , dried and analyzed for N , P , and K. Significant responses to fertilizer N and P were observed at IRRI and PhilRice."
PH1998010357,Plants responded to fertilizer K at PhilRice but not at IRRI.
PH1998010357,The SPAD value was highly correlated with leaf N concentration ( r square = 0.87 - 0.90 ) at midtillering and panicle initiation.
PH1998010357,Severe P deficiency reduced leaf N concentration more than SPAD value at mid-tillering.
PH1998010357,"At panicle initiation , the direct effect of P on SPAD reading wasnegligible"
PH1998010431,Rice yield potential has remained constant since IR8 was released 30 years ago.
PH1998010431,"Despite this apparent yield ceiling , breeding to further increase yield potential continue."
PH1998010431,"This study aims to determine the trend in yield potential of IRRI varieties released in different years and compared it with those of traditional varieties , new elite lines , and tropical hybrids."
PH1998010431,Field experiments were conducted at IRRI and PhilRice during the dry season of 1996.
PH1998010431,Fifteen genotypes consisting of IRRI - bred rice varieties were evaluated in these studies.
PH1998010431,Fourteen - day - old rice seedlings were transplanted at a hill spacing of 20 x 20 cm with 4 seedlings per hill.
PH1998010431,The design used was randomized complete block with four replications.
PH1998010431,Plants received a total of 200 kg N / ha.
PH1998010431,Phenological and morphological measurements were done to evaluate any improvement in the IRRI - bred varieties through the years.
PH1998010431,Grain yield was taken from a 5 sq m plot and expressed at 14 percent moisture content.
PH1998010431,"Average across locations , yield of IRRI - released varieties increased by 75 kg / ha or 1 percent per year."
PH1998010431,The increase in yields of recently bred varieties was due to larger sink size coupled with heavier grain weight.
PH1998010431,This resulted to increase sink capacity ( spikelet number per sq m x mean grain weight ) or potential grain yield.
PH1998010431,"Despite the high biomass and larger sink size of the early bred varieties such as IR26 , yields were low due to poor grain - filling percentage and low grain weight."
PH1998010431,"Varieties released from 1984 to 1985 generally had short growth duration , shoot stature , and low biomass production."
PH1998010431,"Although grain filling was improved in these varieties , the sink capacity limited their grain yield."
PH1998010431,These findings indicate that the yield increase of IRRI - bred varieties was a result of the improvement in sinkcapacity
PH1998010436,"Soil organic matter ( SOM ) plays a pivotal role in soil N cycling , but it is especially important in lowland rice soils , where 25 - 80 percent of the N taken up by the crop has cycled through SOM."
PH1998010436,Grain yields have declined by 35 - 40 percent in fields supporting continuous double - and tripple - cropped irrigated rice for 20 - 30 yr.
PH1998010436,It was hypothesized that improved soil aeration will reverse changes in SOM chemistry and soil N availability that may be linked to the declining grain yields.
PH1998010436,"Any relationships between crop N uptake , mineralizable SOM - N , and the quantity and chemical nature of SOM as affected by soil aeration are being studied."
PH1998010436,"Much of this work has occurred in a previously double - cropped irrigated rice fields on the IRRI farm , which for the last 4 yrs has supported wet season ( WS ) rice and dry season main plot treatments of irrigated rice and upland maize."
PH1998010436,Annual aeration during the maize crop has resulted in gradually increasing effects on soil N cycling during successive WS rice crops.
PH1998010436,"Some properties of the SOM have also evolved gradually with annual soil aeration , even while the amounts of SOM and visible light absorption by extracted humic acid fractions change cyclically by cropping season."
PH1998010436,"In general , the SOM appears to be losing its capacity to buffer soil N availability : by the fourth WS in the minus N fertilizer control treatment , the rice - maize system had 12 percent lower grain yield than did the rice - rice system."
PH1998010436,"Future studies will monitor the continuing evolution of soil N supply with regular soil aeration and will quantify the soil N buffering capacity , changes in the structural chemistry of the SOM , and rates of incorporation into the SOM of rice and maize cropresidues"
PH1998010440,The development of management strategies for greater N fertilizer use efficiency depends on improving the congruence between crop demand and N supply from soil and fertilizer.
PH1998010440,Crop N demand is determined by the daily requirement of dry matter ( DM ) and N accumulation to achieve a given yield level.
PH1998010440,"To compare patterns of DM and N accumulation in irrigated rice grown in the dry season ( DS ) under a wide range of N supply environments , data were obtained from four field experiments with different N fertilizer rate and timing treatments conducted at IRRI and PhilRice."
PH1998010440,"In all experiments , treatments included two to three split applications of 60 kg N / ha applied at transplanting ( TP ) , mid-tillering ( MT ) , and / or panicle initiation ( PI ) , with or without additional 45 kg N / ha applied at flowering ( FL )."
PH1998010440,The Weibull function was used to quantify the relationship between DM or N accumulation rates and thermal time ( i.e. cumulative degree days at 8 deg C threshold ).
PH1998010440,Mean rice yield ranged from 9.1 to 9.9 t / ha.
PH1998010440,Total plant N accumulation ranged from 130 to 206 kg / ha.
PH1998010440,"In all treatments , the thermal time of the point of maximum DM accumulation occurred about 8 - 10 d ( 27 deg C mean daily temperature ) before FL."
PH1998010440,High grain yields that fall within the dry season yield potential range of 9 - 10 t / ha require DM accumulation rates of 200 - 250 kg / ha / d at PI and 260 - 300 kg / ha / d at FL.
PH1998010440,The pattern of N accumulation can vary considerably without a large effect on grain yield in the 9 - 10t / ha range as long as maximum N rate reaches 4 kg / ha / d and the period of rapid - phase N accumulation is more than 23 d ( 27 deg C mean daily temperature ).
PH1998010440,This N accumulation is sufficient to allow adequate leaf development and DM accumulation at key growth stages to support these yield levels.
PH1998010440,Less variation due to N treatments is evident in the rapid phase of DM accumulation which continues through most of the grain - filling period.
PH1998010440,Maximum fertilizer N use efficiency would therefore be achieved by adjusting the timing and rate of split applications to achieve this pattern of N uptake by accounting for the soil N supply and the total crop demand in relation to thermaltime
PH1998010358,Glutamine synthetase ( GS ) is a key enzyme in plant nitrogen ( N ) metabolism.
PH1998010358,"The GS activity of roots and the topmost fully expanded leaves of field - grown rice plants was measured 1 day before N topdressing at midtillering , panicle initiation , flowering and 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 days after topdressing."
PH1998010358,GS activity was measured by spectrophotometry after the semi-synthetic reaction of the extract with hydroxylamine.
PH1998010358,"Leaf and root GS activities were significantly increased by urea N applied , at different growth stages."
PH1998010358,The stimulation of GS activity by N was greatest at midtillering and reduced at later stages.
PH1998010358,Root GS activity showed greater response to N application at midtillering and panicle initiation than leaf GS activity ; the opposite was found at flowering.
PH1998010358,Electrophoretic analysis of GS isoforms showed that the increase in total GS activity of roots and leaves after N topdressing was due to the synthesis of Gsrb ( inducible form ) in roots and GS2 ( chloroplasts form ) in leaves and that the activity of Gsra ( constitutive form ) in roots and GS1 ( cytosolic form ) in leaves remained constant.
PH1998010358,"Regardless of N application , the lower root GS activity at flowering compared with that at midtillering and panicle initiation suggests that root GS activity may limit N uptake during ripening in irrigatedrice"
PH1998010356,Limited oxygen diffusion during complete submergence of plants is a major growth - limiting factor because oxygen is required for energy production.
PH1998010356,"In the absence of oxygen , alcoholic fermentation generates the energy necessary for either maintenance or growth processes , resulting in plants with submergence tolerance or elongation ability."
PH1998010356,Optimization of maintenance vs. growth processes affects survival because elongation growth competes for energy and carbohydrates reserves which are essential for maintenance processes during submergence.
PH1998010356,This study ( 1 ) evaluated the importance of some physiological traits in seedlings of five rice cultivars exposed to complete submergence and ( 2 ) presented information to elucidate the mechanism of submergence tolerance in rice.
PH1998010356,"The carbohydrate content before submergence , elongation growth and activities of enzymes in alcoholic fermentation and glycolysis during submergence , plant survival after submergence , and other relevant parameters were measured."
PH1998010356,There was high correlation between seed carbohydrate content and survival in 2 - wk - old seedlings ( r square = 0.80 - 0.90 ).
PH1998010356,Reduced elongation growth during submergence increased survival in 4 - wk - old seedlings ( r square = 0.81 ).
PH1998010356,Enzyme activity data suggested that pyruvate decarboxylase and phosphofructokinases may limit submergencetolerance
PH1998010353,The NPT lines showed poor grain - filling percentage in earlier agronomic traits.
PH1998010353,The grain - filling percentage of 20 entries in PBGB 's NPT [ Plant Breeding Germplasm Bank New Plant Type ] observational yield and of some bulu parents were evaluated during the 1996 wet season.
PH1998010353,The panicles were threshed and the filled spikelets were separated by submerging them in tap water.
PH1998010353,The empty spikelets were separated from the half - filled spikelets by a columnar seed blower after drying.
PH1998010353,Three lines each from IR66160 and IR65600 had higher than 70 percent filled spikelets.
PH1998010353,IT66160 -121-4-1-1 and IR 66160 -120-4-4-2 had the highest filling percentage.
PH1998010353,All the IR66160 lines had good filling percentages but the IR6560 lines showed a wide range of filling percentage.
PH1998010353,This suggests that selection for good filling percentage may be useful in improving the yield potential of the NPT.
PH1998010353,The highest percentage of half - filled spikelets was 38 percent.
PH1998010353,"If these spikelets can be completely filled , the yield potential of the NPT will be greatly enhanced."
PH1998010353,"Among the bulu parents evaluated , Bali Ontjer had the best filling percentage of 84 percent."
PH1998010353,It has smaller panicles but more panicles per hill.
PH1998010353,"However , good filling percentage is generally not associated with small spikelet number per panicle."
PH1998010353,"It is interesting to note that IR68022 -50-2-1 , which had the lowest filling percentage of 37.6 percent , has Sengkeu as its bulu parent which had the lowest filling percentage of 19.3 percentamon"

RO1999000093,Acidic and sorption properties of biomass are studied as criteria for evaluation maize adaptability to a combined effect of soil pH and copper toxicity.

RO1999000079,"The effect of mixed inoculation of bean "" Cher ( black ) Starozagorski "" cultivar on symbiotic nitrogen fixation was studied."
RO1999000079,A pot experiment with calcareous chernozem was carried out.
RO1999000079,It was established that the effect of mixed inoculation of bean depends on the Rhizobium strain.
RO1999000079,The results show a positive effect in case of double inoculation of bean with 38 R. leguminosarum biovar phaseoli and A. chroococcum 9a and 42a strain with A. brasilense Sp. 107.
RO1999000079,The virulence is improved and nitrogen fixing activity is increased and that leads to increasing the yield.
RO1999000079,"Positive effect is established also in case of the triple bean inoculation with 14a R. leguminosarum biovar phaseoli , A. brasilense Sp. 107 and A. chroococcum 9a."
RO1999000090,On the basis of reflectance 's characteristics were calculated vegetative indices corresponding on 4 stages of plant growth.
RO1999000090,One of these indices can be recommended for the estimation of the Cd pollution in the grey forest soil under alfalfa cropping conditions.
RO1999000078,"The quantity of bacteria , fungi , actinomycetes along the soil profile of leached smolnitza , contaminated with crude oil has been studied."
RO1999000078,A high rate and reliable positive correlation has been established between the quantity of bacteria and crude oil in the soil layers.
RO1999000078,The quantity of bacteria in the soil layers could be described by means of a linear regressive equation.
RO1999000078,"There is no estimated presence of correlation among the quantity of crude oil in the soil and cellulose - degrading bacteria , fungi and actinomycetes and on this basis it 4 concluded that they do not depend by the presence or absence of the contaminant."
RO1999000091,"The relationship between mobile forms of Cd , Ni , Cr and Hg and the concentration of the elements in alfalfa has been studied in a pot experiment."
RO1999000091,Four levels of pH ranging from 4 to 7 have been created to an acid ( light gray forest ) soil.
RO1999000091,"5 levels of pollution with Cd , Ni , Cr and Hg were created for each level of pH. The mobile forms were extracted by 1 M NH4NO3."
RO1999000091,The relationship between mobile Cd in the soil and Cd concentration in alfalfa for all levels of pH and pollution were described by a single equation.
RO1999000091,Similar single equation relationships were found for Cr and for Hg.
RO1999000091,The experimental points for Ni are divided in two groups which are described by two equations.
RO1999000091,"One equation is for points of pH 7 and higher , and another equation is for points of pH 4.3 - 5.6."
RO1999000091,The existence of two relationships for Ni shows that application of large amounts of CaCO3 and over-liming the soil decrease drastically the extractability of Ni by 1 M NH4NO3 while the availability of Ni to the plant does not change to the same extent and remains comparatively high.
RO1999000091,The possible explanation is that at high pH NiCO3 and basic Nickel carbonate 2NiCO3 .3 Ni ( OH ) 2.4 H2O of lower solubility are formed.
RO1999000091,"The results suggest that mobile Cd , Cr and Hg can be extracted by 1 M NH4NO3 from soils of pH 4.3 - 7.0."
RO1999000091,The extraction of mobile forms of Ni in the presence of CaCO3 / Ca ( HCO3 ) 2 needs to take into account pH of the soil.
RO1999000089,"The Lead - Zinc Smelter near the town of Plovdiv is situated in an intensive agricultural region where different crops are grown - forages , tobacco , cereals , fruits , vegetables , orchards and vineyards."

RO1999000089,"The significant correlation between total content of Cd , Pb and Zn in soil and plants are observed for the forages but not for cereals , fruits and vegetables."
RO1999000089,"Although the mobile form extracted by 1M NH4NO3 correspond to the heavy metal content especially in the forage crops , they depends markedly stronger on the total content than to the pH value in soils."
RO1999000096,The study uses results from the green - house experiments to determine the effect of sludge from a plant for starch products as a fertilizer.
RO1999000096,"Green - house experiments are over carbonate - black soils in Rakovsky - town , near to the waste - water treatment station of the plant."

RO1999000080,"A study was carried out on the effects of N - source , fertilizer rate and soil acidity on nitrate reductase activity , nitrate accumulation and plastid pigment content in lettuce ( Lactuca sativa L. )."
RO1999000080,Plastid pigment content in lettuce leaves increased with the increasing fertilizer rate and beneficial effect of urea N - source on the chlorophyll and carotenoid content was observed in the plants grown in the strongly acid soil.
RO1999000080,Fertilizer rate of 4g salts per kg soil reduced nitrate reductase activity in all treatments excepting the plants grown in the strongly acid soil and treated with urea as a N - source.
RO1999000080,Plants grown in the strongly acid soil had the highest NO3 - content and reached the acceptable limit concentration at lower fertilizer rate as compared to the plants grown in the weakly acid and middle acid soils.

RO1999000019,A pot experiment with alfalfa as test plant was carried out on an eutric planosol treated with organo - mineral compost obtained from anthracite coal dust and Ca.
RO1999000019,A significant increase of the yield in comparison to the control and to the standard ameliorates have been established.
RO1999000019,The data obtained proved the possibility of coagulation occurring between the differently charged soil colloids and the applied materials.
RO1999000019,The additional treatment of the soil with Ca - humates facilitated the integration between the mineral and the organic part through cation bridges and the stability to the hydroameliorative influences increased.
RO1999000019,"The most probable effect of the soil treatment with Fe ( OH ) 3 , was its co-precipitation with the negative charged soil adsorbent in acid medium."
RO1999000019,As a result the Al - mobility decreased to a non toxic degree for plant growth without changing the soil pH. The plant yields was much higher than that in the control.
RO1999000019,In the treated acid soil with Fe ( OH ) 3 and Ca humates a compensation of the acidic effect of the free hydrogen occurred and pH increased.

RO1999000043,"By using dynamic modelling of the reproductive process of Zea Mays , an yield estimation with a maximum relative error of + - 1,3 per cent has been obtained."

RO1999000065,The objectives of the study were to evaluate evolution of micromorphological properties in the intensive crop agricultural lands in semiarid Northern Crimea coastal plain.
RO1999000065,"Farming dryland with different management techniques , with and without irrigation performed on Dark chestnut soils or Calcic Kastanozems ( FAO ) were investigated."

RO1999000065,The most consistent and prominent features were observed in the upper humus horizons of the longest irrigated soils.

RO1999000029,"The soil solution is obtained by displacement with ethyl alcohol ( 96 Celsius grade ) and the lysimetric waters are collected by lysimetric plates , installed under 50 and 100 cm from the top of the soil."
RO1999000029,The data show that according to its chemical nature soil liquid phase may be referred to the surface water with low mineralization ( below 1 g / l ).
RO1999000029,The reaction of the soil solution and lysimetric water is neutral and a tendency to decreasing of the pH values as a result of the long - term use of fertilizers is observed.
RO1999000029,"The ions of calcium , nitrates and hydrocarbonates are prevalent and the content of magnesium , sodium and chlorine are lower and varied from 10 to 40 mg / l."
RO1999000029,The concentrations of potassium do not exceed 5 mg / l and phosphorus - 1 mg / l respectively.

RO1999000023,A study was performed with an inhibitor of nitrification N - serve and a slow release N - fertiliser IBDU on calcareous chernozem in view to establish the nitrogen distribution between the soil 's layer of a soil profile 0 - 90 cm.
RO1999000023,It is evident that the inhibitor of nitrification N - serve and the slow release N - fertiliser IBDU decreased markedly the penetration of mineral - N in soil depth to the layers 30 - 60 cm and 60 - 90 cm in the early spring season.
RO1999000023,"When middle and high fertilisation rates of nitrogen are applied in urea and ammonium nitrate form without an inhibitor the mineral - N can be found in the layer 30 - 60 cm , mainly while if IBDU and inhibitor is applied , it can be found in the layer 0 - 30 cm to 60cm"
RO1999000035,"In a previous work on the response of lucerne to alkaline and alkaline earth carbonates , CaCl2 and Ca ( NO3 ) 2 , it has been established that cations and anions of the ameliorating agents have their separate influence on the yield."
RO1999000035,It seems that the mechanism of such influence is connected to the physical environment of roots rather to the chemical reactions of the metabolism.
RO1999000035,Three plant species were chosen for this investigation.
RO1999000035,They are more tolerant to soil acidity then the lucerne and their tolerance to acid conditions increases in the order mentioned above.

RO1999000035,"According to the counted ISD , it becomes obvious that liming has a slight favourable effect on sunflower yield , and partly on the maize yield."
RO1999000035,Plastering has not a proved influence on the yield.
RO1999000035,"The comparison between the relative content of Ca in the different variations showed that the differences between liming and plastering are not drastic , as they were observed when the soil has been treated with CaCl2 or Ca ( NO3 ) 2."

FR1998000223,"With plant acclimation , biomass production increased only up to 8 % with elevated CO2 , as compared to a maximum increase of 20 % in the absence of plant acclimation."
FR1998000223,Reduced yield with CC was obtained for sites with low soil water holding capacity.
FR1998000223,Decreased evapotranspiration and increased WUE with 2Ã — CO2 were partially offset by CC.
FR1998000223,"The simulations indicated that productivity of managed grassland is sensitive to different assumptions about changes in climate , CO2 concentration , and photosynthetic acclimation , and that the effects of elevated CO2 are modified by CC and depend on local soil conditions."
GB1997024478,Cation exchange capacity ( CEC ) and reducing capacity ( RC ) in relation to compost stability and quality were studied.
GB1997024478,"The results show that grape prunings , husks and seeds compost and vine branches compost were nearly stabilized after 120 days of composting."

GB1997027800,"The evidence of detrimental effects of ozone on vegetation in Europe , and the need to develop international control policies to reduce ozone exposures which are based on the effects of the pollutant , has led to attempts to define so - called critical levels of ozone above which adverse effects on trees , crops and natural vegetation may occur."
GB1997027800,This review is a critical assessment of the scientific basis of the concepts used to define critical levels for ozone and identifies the key limitations and uncertainties involved.
GB1997027800,"The review focuses on the Level I critical level approach , which provides an environmental standard or threshold to minimise the effects of ozone on sensitive receptors , but does not seek to quantify the impacts of exceeding the critical level under field conditions."
GB1997027800,The concept of using the AOT ( accumulated exposure over a threshold ) to define long - term ozone exposure is demonstrated to be appropriate for several economically important species.
GB1997027800,"The use of 40 ppb ( giving the AOT40 index ) as a threshold concentration gives a good linear fit to experimental data from open - top chambers for arable crops , but it is less certain that it provides the best fit to data for trees or semi-natural communities."
GB1997027800,"Major uncertainties in defining critical level values relate to the choice of response parameter and species ; the absence of data for many receptors , especially those of Mediterranean areas ; and extrapolation to field conditions from relatively short - term open - top chamber experiments."
GB1997027800,"The derivation of critical levels for long - lived organisms , such as forest trees , may require the use of modelling techniques based on physiological data from experimental studies."
GB1997027800,"The exposure - response data which have been applied to derive critical levels should not be used to estimate the impacts of ozone over large areas , because of the uncertainties associated with extrapolation from the open - top chamber method , especially for forest trees , and because of spatial variation in atmospheric and environmental conditions , which may alter ozone uptake."

GB1999004406,Results from four field studies show that communities of trapâ € nesting bees and wasps and their natural enemies are promising bioindicators for ecological change or habitat quality.
GB1999004406,"These small and easyâ € toâ € handle communities can be analysed with respect to ( i ) species richness and related parameters , and ( ii ) ecological functions or interactions."

GB1999004406,"Accordingly , these studies emphasize the significance of a continuum of old habitat patches for the augmentation of natural enemies."
GB1999004406,"Exposure of standardized traps is an experimental approach with a small , interacting and reproducing community that can be easily characterized by simple parameters."
GB1999004406,"Taxonomy and biology are well known , and quick evaluations can be done using the close correlation between the number of occupied traps and species richness."

BG1999000473,"The role of various ameliorative systems for improving soil hydrophysical characteristics and soil water regime , with respect to increasing crop yields is situated."
BG1999000473,Some types of ameliorative systems are examined.
BG1999000473,Two of three variants about the drain 's distance were observed.
BG1999000473,Our investigations show that ameliorative managements improve the filtration characteristics of soil profile and regulate the soil water regime.
BG1999000473,As a result of treatment the agricultural crop yields increase repeatedly in comparison with those in naturel condition.

PH2000100091,Small native species ( SNS ) of fish are an important source of protein and income for rural people in Bangladesh.
PH2000100091,A rapid rural appraisal study was carried out to explore recent changes in the availability of SNS in relation to agroecology and related issues.
PH2000100091,Village residents noted that the availability of SNS had declined drastically due to habitat loss related to agricultural intensification and due to the restriction of access to the remaining habitats in the course of aquaculture development.
PH2000100091,Their perception was that poor people had gained from the intensification of agriculture in terms of rice consumption but had lost in terms of reduced access to fish and other animalproducts
PH1999101394,Transpiration is a vital process in the life cycle of plants.
PH1999101394,"It promotes water absorption , nutrient uptake , and cooling of the plant , which are necessary for survival under rainfed and upland environments where crops are subjected to intermittent periods of water deficit."
PH1999101394,Transpiration is regulated by stomata and stomatal closure is the initial reaction of plants to water stress to prevent excessive drying.
PH1999101394,"However , stomates also serve as entry points of CO2 used in photosynthesis , such that the ability to achieve balance between evaporative loss and gaseous entry highly determined plant adaptation to water deficit."
PH1999101394,Whole plant transpiration involves tedious daily weight measurements.
PH1999101394,"Recently , a parameter called 13C isotope discrimination ( A ) was shown to be a good estimate of water use and water use efficiency."
PH1999101394,It is based on the proportion of natural isotopes 13CO2 and 12CO2 in plant tissue.
PH1999101394,"Under stressed , condition A decreases because the proportion of 13CO2 / 12CO2 increases in stressed C3 leaves."
PH1999101394,"In this study , A was measured on leaves of seedlings of 27 rice cultivars which were subjected to a water deficit of -0.5 MPa for 6 d. Results showed that cultivars with high transpiration rate relative to the control were tolerant of water deficit based on visual scoring."
PH1999101394,"Transpiration rate was highly and positively correlated with A ( r = 0.55 * ] , which implies that plants which are more tolerant of mild water stress have more open stomates and high A. High genotypic variability in A exists among genotypes , which makes selection for high A in rice possible."
PH1999101394,"Carbon isotope discrimination was also highly and negatively correlated with specific leaf weight ( r = 0.78 * ] , which makes specific leaf weight a cheaper substitute forA"
GE2000000106,"Analises of contemporary system of control over pesticides from the point of view of sanitarian norms , as well as agroecological crises is presented in the article."
GE2000000106,Combined effects should be taken into account over pesticides control for creating perfect system.
PH1999101398,Early vigor of hybrid rice in the temperate areas is mainly due to its higher tillering rate compared with inbred cultivars.
PH1999101398,The objective of this study is to identify the factors which contribute to the greater vegetative growth of hybrid rice in the tropics.
PH1999101398,Data from field experiments conducted from 1994 to 1998 were analyzed in both dry and wet seasons at IRRI [ Philippines ] farm.
PH1999101398,Each experiment contained one to four pairs of comparisons between the best hybrids and the best inbreds.
PH1999101398,"Parameters used for comparison were tiller production rate ( TPR ) , leaf area expansion rate ( LAER ) , and crop growth rate ( CGR ) between transplanting and midtillering and also midtillering and panicle initiation."
PH1999101398,"In most cases , hybrids exhibited greater CGR than inbreds either between transplanting and midtillering or between midtillering and panicle initiation or both."
PH1999101398,The difference in CGR was associated with the difference in LAER between hybrids and inbreds.
PH1999101398,The TPR of hybrids were significantly lower or equal to that of inbreds.
PH1999101398,"Therefore , the greater vegetative growth of hybrid rice in the tropics is associated with larger leaf area development , not withtillering"
PH1999101397,Grain filling is one of the major factors limiting the expression of yield potential in new plant type ( NPT ) rice.
PH1999101397,This study aimed to dtermine the grain - filling pattern of NPT lines and its relation to grain - filling percentage.
PH1999101397,"This experiment was conducted at the International Rice Research Institute ( IRRI ) [ Philippines ] farm in the 1998 wet season with three NPT lines ( IR65600 -42-5-2 , IR65600 -127-6-2-3 , IR65598 -112-2 ) and one indica inbred , IR72."
PH1999101397,Grain - filling pattern was determined by measuring the grain - filling rate of superior and inferior spikelets every 3 days after flowering.
PH1999101397,"Three grain - filling patterns were found , i.e. , fast synchronous ( IR65600 -42-5-2 , IR72 ) : both superior and inferior spikelets started filling early and reached the maximum filling rate nearly at the same time , and their filling was fast at the early stage ; slow synchronous ( IR65598 -112-2 ) : both superior and inferior spikelets started filling and reached the maximum filling rate nearly at the same time , but their filling rate was slow at the early filling stage ; and a synchronous ( IR65600 -127-6-2-3 ) : superior spikelets started filling and reached the maximum tillering rate much earlier than the inferior ones."
PH1999101397,Grain - filling percentage was closely associated with grain - filling patterns.
PH1999101397,"The fast synchronous had the highest , and the slow synchronous the lowest grain - filling percentage among three NPT lines."
PH1999101397,These results suggested that grain - filling patterns vary among NPT lines and that it is possible to improve grain - filling in NPT lines by selecting lines with fast synchronous grainfilling
BG2000000146,"The article reflects the results of testing the influence of fertilizer nitrogen source on dry matter accumulation and assimilation of macro - and microelements by sunflower in field and pot experiments , the cation - anion balance , tissue pH and nitrate reductase activity of the organs , supplied with NO3 - and NH4 + in different ratios and concentrations as well as different development stages."
BG2000000146,The maximum supply of NO3 - N ( pH = 5.5 ) secures large dry matter accumulation that the maximum supply of NH4 - N ( pH = 7 ).
BG2000000146,The application of ammonium fertilizers or nitrification inhibitors right after sowing would be harmful to sunflower.
BG2000000073,Pot experiments were conducted with maize ( Zea mays L. ) grown in nutrient solutions and on soil substrate.
BG2000000073,The following indices were studied : 1.
BG2000000073,Differences in tissue pH between plant organs ( transorgan tissue pH gradients ).
BG2000000073,The NRA ( nitrate reductase activity ) of organs.
BG2000000073,Cation - anion balance in the shoot.
BG2000000073,All the indices were studied as a function of N source and plant age.
BG2000000073,"The introduction given proof of the understanding , that the excretion of H + from the roots of intact plants is the result of the function of an auxin dependent ATPase ( H + pump ) in the cells of the leaves and that there exist extra stelar transport pathway to the roots for the H + produced in the leaf cells."
PH1999101399,The new plant type ( NPT ) of rice is a low - tillering variety with big stems and large panicles.
PH1999101399,"However , earlier results showed that the yield potential of NPT is limited by poor grain filling."
PH1999101399,"In rice , most carbon ( C ) required for yield is assimilated during grain filling."
PH1999101399,It is therefore important to know the fate of C assimilated at flowering and at mid-flowering.
PH1999101399,The study was conducted to compare the 14C translocation of high - yielding irrigated rice ( IR72 ) with that of NPT.
PH1999101399,Labelled carbon dioxide ( 14CO2 ) was introduced to each flagleaf blade of the main tiller of IR72 and IR65598 -112-2 ( an NPT line ) at two stages of development during grain filling ; at flowering ( 0 DAF ) and at 14 d after flowering ( 14 DAF ).
PH1999101399,"At each stage , four plants of each cultivar were harvested 30 min after 14CO2 exposure to determine initial 14C distribution."
PH1999101399,"Additional plants were harvested at 1 , 3 , and 7 d after exposure ( DAE ) to follow the 14C - distribution pattern."
PH1999101399,"Plant parts were separated , freeze - dried , ground and the activity determined using the Packard Model 2500TR liquid scintillation counter."
PH1999101399,"When flagleaf was exposed at 0 DAF , 14C distribution showed that 71 percent of the total activity in IR72 and 57 percent of that in NPT were exported from the flagleaf to the other plant organs."
PH1999101399,"It was observed that panicles were the major sink , receiving about 65 percent for IR72 and 35 percent for NPT up to 7 DAE."
PH1999101399,Stem acted as a temporary storage organ since 89 percent of the total activity found at 1 DAE in the stem was remobilized to the panicle in IR72 as compared with 30 percent in the NPT.
PH1999101399,The distribution of 14C and 14 DAF was similar to that found at 0 DAF except that a much lower proportion of activity was translocated to the NPT panicles.
PH1999101399,It can be concluded that there are significant differences in the distribution of photoassimilates within the plant during the grain filling stage between IR72 and the NPT.
PH1999101399,The photoassimilates are exported from the flagleaf to the stem and finally to the panicle more rapidly in IR72.
PH1999101399,"The NPT on the other hand , a considerable amount of assimilates remains both in the flagleaf and the stem , and less amount reaches thepanicles"
BG2000000015,"The bitter extracts of Galeoplasis tetrachid and Marrubium peregrinum in 2 % and 1 % , applied indepedently and dirrectly against adults to Macrolofus costalis was shown mortality between 2 and 26 % in interval 1 - 4 days after treatment.Unrafined grape seed oil in consentration 0.5 % in the same condition killed between 2 % and 11 % on adults.The standard Parak in 0.4 % - between 3 % - 17 % , respectively.The combination of 2 % from G. tetrahit with 0.5 % of un rafined grape oil was more tolerants upon M. costalis."
PH1999101400,Rainfed lowland makes up 27 percent of the rice area worldwide with Asia as the highest producer ( 29 percent ) of rainfed lowland rice.
PH1999101400,Drought and submergence are the two abiotic stresses in this rice ecosystem.
PH1999101400,Extensive studies had been conducted to characterize traits for tolerance for each stress and to develop cultivars with improved tolerance.
PH1999101400,"However , in most rainfed lowland areas , rice plants are often exposed to both stresses within a cropping season."
PH1999101400,"Under such environments , cultivars with tolerance for both stresses together will be able to show better performance."
PH1999101400,This ability is called cross tolerance.
PH1999101400,"Cross tolerance can be defined as the ability of the plant to tolerate sequential hydrologic stresses , inadequate and excess water that is a usual occurrence in rainfed lowland areas."
PH1999101400,"In the present study , the relationship between drought tolerance and submergence tolerance in young rice seedlings was investigated."
PH1999101400,"Genotypes that had been identified as tolerant of or susceptible to drought and submergence and selected by breeders as cross tolerant were included in the study ( FR13A , IR42 , BKNFR76106 -16-0-1 , IR20 , IR57515 - PM1 -8-1-1-SRN-1-1 , P1163575 , MOROBEREKAN , T36307 and T36314 )."
PH1999101400,Adding polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) at -0.5 MPa ( intermediate stress ) and -1.0 MPa ( severe stress ) simulated drought stress in hydroponic culture.
PH1999101400,"To induce submergence stress , plants were completely submerged in a concrete water tank."
PH1999101400,Visual scoring was used to characterize the levels of resistance of the plant to the stress.
PH1999101400,"Visual scores reflecting intermediate , and severe drought stress were highly correlated."
PH1999101400,In terms of percent survival positive correlation was obtained between both stresses.
PH1999101400,Paraquat treatment of leaf segments revealed high activities of active oxygen - scavenging systems in most cultivars.
PH1999101400,The study suggests that cross tolerance for both drought and submergence may exist and that tolerance may be improved further through conventional and molecularbreeding
PH2000100244,The breeding of the new rice plant type ( NPT ) with large panicles and few tillers using tropical japonica germplasm aims to break the yield potential barrier of 10 t / ha in the tropics.
PH2000100244,"However , field tests conducted between 1994 and 1997 in several sites indicated low yield from NPT lines due to their poor grain filling and low biomass production."
PH2000100244,"The previous design of the NPT was slightly modified by moderately increasing tillering capacity , plant height , and growth duration , and slightly decreasing panicle size."
PH2000100244,Grain yield and yield components of 43 NPT lines in the 1998 dry season ( DS ) and 51 NPT lines in the 1998 wet season ( WS ) were measured in a nonreplicated observational trial.
PH2000100244,"In 1998 DS , seven NPT lines produced yields greater than or the same as that of IR72."
PH2000100244,"In 1998 WS , 30 NPT lines had yields greater than or equal to that of IR72."
PH2000100244,The NPT line IR65600 -42-5-2 yielded 7.67 t / ha in 1998 WS as compared with IR72 's 5.02.
PH2000100244,These results indicate significant progress in improving NPT yields in recentyears
PH2000100249,Nitrogen use efficiency is an important varietal trait because of the high cost of N fertilizer and the increasing concern about environmental pollution from fertilizer losses in rice fields.
PH2000100249,The objective of this study was to determine the differences in N use efficiency of rice varieties developed in the Philippines since 1966.
PH2000100249,"Eight rice varieties ( BPI - 76 , IR8 , IR30 , IR36 , IR64 , IR72 , IR65469 -161-2-2-3-2-2 , IR68284H ) were grown at the International Rice Research Institute ( IRRI ) farm during the 1998 dry season under four N rates ( 0 , 60 , 120 , and 200 kg / ha )."
PH2000100249,"Grain yield , total dry matter , and total N uptake were measured at maturity to calculate N recovery efficiency ( RE ) , physiological N use efficiency ( PNUE ) , agronomic N use efficiency ( ANUE ) , and partial factor productivity of applied N ( PFP )."
PH2000100249,Data indicate that there was no significant differences in RE among the varieties.
PH2000100249,The new varieties had significantly higher PNUE and PFP than the old varieties.
PH2000100249,"Although ANUE in the new varieties tended to be higher , the difference was not significant."
PH2000100249,The greater internal N use efficiency of the new varieties maybe attributed to their greater crop growth rate as compared with that of the oldvarieties
JP1999003790,Ascorbate content and the activities of ascorbat free - radical reductase ( AFR - R ) and ascorbate peroxidase ( APX ) were investigated in order to determine whether they are affected under Fe deficiency.
JP1999003790,"Plasma membrane vesicles , ten wall and cytosolic fractions were isolated from the roots of cucumber ( Cucumis sativus L. ) plants grown in the absence or in the presence of Fe."
JP1999003790,"Plasma membrane vesicles showed NADH - dependent reducing activities with Fe ( 3 + ) - citrate , ferricyanide and AFR as electron acceptors."
JP1999003790,Only AFR - R activity was stimulated ca. 3-fold in Fe deficient plasma membranes.
JP1999003790,"No significant change in cytosolic AFR - R activity was induced by Fe depletion , while the activity of cytosolic APX was more than twice that of the non-deficient control."
JP1999003790,"Furthermore , the content of ascorbate ( AA ) was enhanced ca. 1.7-fold in Fe deficient roots."
JP1999003790,These results indicate that metabolic changes resulting in enhanced AA levels and activities of AFR - R and APX in the roots could be related toplant
BG1999000469,The aim of this study is to make estimation of the sludge utilization from the waste waters treatment stations near Plovdiv as a fertilizer relating on the limitance of heavy metal surplus.
BG1999000469,Our experimence shows that there are different criteria for determination of the limited values.
BG1999000469,Dependent from this criteria the norm for utilization with sludge by previously given duration and periodicality of their use is variable value.

BG1999000458,"The mineralogical experiments indicate that the chromic luvisol clays from Chalkidiki are dominated by smectite and illite , while those from the profiles in Tharacian Vally contain smectit and kaolinite."
BG1999000458,The presence of palligorskyte was most probably caused by the drought climatic conditions.
BG1999000458,"However , in the Bulgarian soils it could be due to transformations of amphiboles and pyroxenes as components of the parent materials , i. e. gneiss."
BG1999000458,The free Fe - oxides ( non-silicate iron ) are characterized by uniform distribution along the profiles of the soils investigated.
UA2002000052,"The article deals with results of experimental research carried out to find quantitative toxicity indices of heavy metals ( Cd , Pb , Cu , Zn )."
UA2002000052,The model developed for the integral estimation of the unsafety of environmental pollution by pesticides is a core this work.
UA2002000052,The base for the criteria of the ecotoxicological estimation of the heavy metals are the comprehensive description of their impact on natural environment and human health.
UA2002000052,"The studies based on the Ecotoxicology Laboratory of the Institute of Agroecology and Biotechnology of UAAS , the Agroecology Department of NAU , the Chernihiv State Experimental Station ( SPA "" Elite "" ) were carried out involving field , lysimetric and vegetation experiments."
UA2002000052,Their critical soil concentrations were found with respect to the test - crop ( spring barley ).
UA2002000052,"When applied into the soil , Zn and Cu in the amount equal to 10 and 15 maximum allowable concentrations ( MAC ) caused the full inhibition of plants , even at their seed germination stage."
UA2002000052,"The conclusion is drawn that for Zn the critical soil concentrations are 3000 mg per kg of soil , for Cu 1000 mg per kg of soil , that is at such concentrations the total ( 100 % ) soil phytotoxicity manifested itself."
UA2002000052,"When applying Cd and Pb , the general plant death was not observed."
UA2002000052,The plant growth inhibition was observed accordingly by 18 % and 21 % only in comparison with the control when Cd made 45 mg per kg ( 15 MAC ) and Pb made 450 mg per kg ( 15 MAC ) in soil.
UA2002000052,"Estimating the metals according to the phytotoxicity criterion was carried out in such a way that Zn and Cu were referred to the class of highly dangerous pollutants , and Cd and Pb - to dangerous ones."
CZ2001000340,It is a well known fact that certain forms of aluminium are potentially toxic to all living organisms.
CZ2001000340,A clear comprehension of the aluminium forms in soil solution and a knowledge of basic soil characteristics enable to diagnose and evaluate aluminum toxicity in plant root environments.
CZ2001000340,That is why a speciation of aluminium is essential for a risk assessment of the aluminium toxicity.
CZ2001000340,The IC method developed under cooperation with company Watrex enables to farther specify the aluminium forms extracted by 0.5 M KCl.
CZ2001000340,"The analysis is performed using cation exchange separation , post-column reaction with Tiron and DAD detection."
CZ2001000340,The mixture of variable aluminium forms was such divided into three groups.
BG2001000048,The leaching of the herbicide metribuzin ( Zino ) in sandy loam soil columns was studied with simulated rainfall of 100 mm as well as its effect on soil microflora.
BG2001000048,Metribuzin was applied in two doses : 80 and 160 g / dka.
BG2001000048,"Metribuzin leaching was established by the depth of soil columns in the following layers : 0 - 10 cm , 10 - 20 cm , 20 - 30 cm and 30 - 45 cm."

PH2001100749,"The motivation to earn cash income , the opportunity provided by the market and capability built - up by technology and resources are the important factors needed for transition from subsistence to commercial production."
PH2001100749,"Transition , however , is not always feasible and direct."
PH2001100749,Technologies specific to the agroecology and product should be verified and established as well as their acceptability to the farmers.
PH2001100749,"Further , economic and technical feasibility should be carefully assessed."
PH2001100749,"In come cases , it is better to leave the subsistence farmer alone or lead him to other livelihood projects other than sweet potato commerical production."
PH2001100749,Research and development intervention is needed to hasten the transition process.
PH2001100749,"Among the required intervention measures are : a ) expansion of market possibilities , b ) utilization of marginal agroecologies where sweet potato has an advantage , c ) creating specialized farms for planting material production , and d ) marketing the better tasting old cultivars as high value products."

CZ2001000333,TDR ( Time Domain Reflectometry ) is an accurate and widely used rapid and non-destructive method for determination of volumetric soil water content Theta of porous media in situ and in laboratory.
CZ2001000333,The objective of this study was to test 23 empirical models to evaluate TDR measurment and calculate Theta ( Epsilon ) for the fine earth samples prepared from certain horizons of three tipical soils commonly found in the Czech Republic.
CZ2001000333,The TDR results were compared to the data determined by gravimetry.
CZ2001000333,"The results of those comparisons shown that there is not any acceptable model for material of Orthic Luvisol , model 5 gives good results for Eutric Regosol and models 3 , 4 , 14 and 15 are good for loess."
CZ2001000333,Absolutely not useful in any case is model 10.
CZ2001000333,The application of recommended models for tested soils can improve accuracy of soil water content calculations from TDR measurements.
CZ2001000336,"Transfers of trace elements into testing plants ( radish , triticale , spinach ) have been studied in pot experiments."
CZ2001000336,"The results have been processed by elementary statistics , factor analysis and multiple regression analyses."
CZ2001000336,The results have proven the differentiated behavior of single elements.
CZ2001000336,"Mn , Cd , Co , Zn and Ni are characterized by both high effective and potential mobility , pH - dependent effective mobility and transfer into plants , adjustable by liming and transfer coefficients 0.01."
CZ2001000336,The hazards of uptake rates depend upon the relative toxicity and uptake rates in relation to critical plant loads.
CZ2001000336,Pb and Cu have a high potential mobility and high share of organic bonds.
CZ2001000336,"Be , As , Cr and V have a low relative effective and potential mobility and transfer coefficients 0.01."
CZ2001000338,"Five soil tillage technologies with using of different organic manuring ( farmyard manure , cattle slurry , strAw + cattle slurry ) were tested in the field experiment on the chernozem in maize growing region."
CZ2001000338,The highest yields of maize for silage were presented by ploughing on 0.22 m. Deeper ploughing ( 0.28 m ) and loosening ( 0.40 m ) reduced the yields.
CZ2001000338,Soil tillage technologies with increased yield levels showed the higher soil water content in the beginning and lower at the end of vegetation.
CZ2001000338,Fertilizing with straw + cattle slurry resulted in drier condition into significant decreasing of soil water content and maize sillage yields.
PH2001100343,Drinking water in rural areas is often drawn from groundwater through shallow tube - wells.
PH2001100343,Intensive rice - based cropping systems are practised in some areas where farmers plant rice during the wet season and upland crops during the dry season.
PH2001100343,"The upland crops are frequently irrigated utilizing groundwater and received heavy applications of chemical inputs , which may contaminate the aquifer."
PH2001100343,Nitrate contamination of shallow groundwater under intensive rice - upland cropping systems was monitored across Ilocos Norte [ Philippines ] in 1997 - 99.
PH2001100343,"The selected measurement sites , represent major upland crops , such as sweet pepper , garlic , tobacco , tomato , and maize."
PH2001100343,"For comparison , rice - rice and rice - fallow systems were also monitored."
PH2001100343,Groundwater samples were collected from domestic tube - wells in residential areas and from installed field tube - wells ( used for irrigation ) within the boundaries of the cropped areas.
PH2001100343,Shallow groundwater under the rice - sweet pepper system had the highest nitrate - N concentrations of about 7 - 11 ppm.
PH2001100343,Second was groundwater under rice - garlic and rice - tomato with 4 - 5 ppm nitrate - N.
PH2001100343,The nitrate - N concentration under rice - rice and rice - fallow systems were almost equal at about 1 ppm.
PH2001100343,"Fertilizer N application was 450 kg N / ha in rice - sweet pepper , 250 - 350 kg N / ha in rice - garlic and rice - tomato , 100 kg N / ha in rice - fallow and 200 kg N / ha in rice - rice systems."
PH2001100343,Most nitrate - N concentrations found in rice - pepper exceeded the maximum permissible level of 10 ppm for drinking water.
PH2001100343,It is important to find technologies that minimize nitrate pollution of groundwater under this croppingpattern
PH2001100478,"When a plant is exposed to water stress , its immediate response to minimize tissue dehydration is by partial closure of stomates."
PH2001100478,This closure of stomata under the light causes photoinhibition because of excessive energy production.
PH2001100478,This photoinhibition causes irreversible damage to the chloroplast.
PH2001100478,"Plants have various protective mechanisms to photoinhibition , including thermal dissipation of energy , the Mehler reaction , the zeaxanthin cycle , and the removal of active oxygen species ( AOS )."
PH2001100478,"In this research , the involvement of AOS system in drought stress is identified."
PH2001100478,"After a 3 - day stress , the CAT ( catalase ) activity in all cultivars increased."
PH2001100478,"After a 6 - day stress , the SOD ( superoxide dismutase ) activity in all cultivars increased and drought - tolerant cultivar IR52 has the highest SOD activity."
PH2001100478,Only IR52 increased in APX ( ascorbic peroxidase activity.
PH2001100478,"This may indicate that rice plants have increased photo - respiration during the 3 - day stress , but when drought stress continues , they need to activate AOS system to avoid production of excessive energy."
PH2001100478,The AOS system plays an important role in alleviating drought stress and APX may be a key enzyme in thatsystem
PH2001100339,"The cultivars used were IR72 , a new plant type ( NPT ) and a hybrid."
PH2001100339,"Fertilizer at rates of 620-120-120 and 360-120-200 kg NPK / ha were applied during the dry season ( DS ) and wet season ( WS ) , respectively."
PH2001100339,Lodging control was imposed on the NPT using string support at normal hill spacing ( 20 cm x 10 cm ).
PH2001100339,"Other densities tested for lodging control were 1 , 2 and 4 hills / sq m. NPT and IR72 yielded about 10 t / ha at normal densities , despite the high stem borer infestation in 1998 DS."
PH2001100339,Mean yield from NPT hills with the least stem borer damage was 12.0 t / ha.
PH2001100339,"In 1999 DS , yields under normal spacing declined due to lodging."
PH2001100339,"Yields of hybrid and NPT at 1 hill / sq m was only 75 % and 37 % of normal density , respectively."
PH2001100339,"In 1999 WS , all crops under normal spacing lodged and potential yield was not realized."
PH2001100339,Yields from plots with wide hill spacing did not match those with normal spacing except when severe lodging occurred.
PH2001100339,"No lodging occurred at 1 , 2 , 4 hills / sq m in all seasons."
PH2001100339,High tillering ability is necessary to increase yields under wide hill spacing.
PH2001100339,Grain yields greater than 10 t / ha can be obtained from modern cultivars if damage from pests and diseases can beeliminated
PH2001100474,"Cultivar IR72 was grown at IRRI { Los Banos , Laguna , Philippines ] farm in the dry ( DS ) and wet season ( WS ) of 1999 at a 20 - x 20 - cm spacing."
PH2001100474,"Nitrogen rate ( kg / ha ) of fix - schedule N management was 150 and 225 in the DS and 0 , 60 and 120 in the WS , applied as basal and topdressed at midtillering , panicle initiation , and flowering."
PH2001100474,The SPAD - based and tiller - based N management were included as N treatments in both DS and WS.
PH2001100474,Weekly SPAD measurements and tiller counting were conducted 2 weeks after transplanting up to flowering.
PH2001100474,Threshold levels of tiller number at a given growth stage were determined from previous experiments where a maximum yield of IR72 was achieved.
PH2001100474,"In SPAD - based N treatment , 20 - 45 kg N / ha was applied when SPAD value was below 35."
PH2001100474,"When tiller number per sq m was below the threshold level and when daily tillering rate was smaller than 30 sq m , 20 - 45 kg N / ha was applied in the tiller - based N treatment plots."
PH2001100474,The SPAD and tiller - based N treatments received N three times at the same growth stages with a total input of 105 kg N / ha is the DS and 60 kg N / ha in the WS.
PH2001100474,"Because amount and timing of N topdressing in both SPAD and tiller - based N treatments were the same , the grain yield and N use efficiency were comparable in the two treatments."
PH2001100474,"However , the SPAD and tiller - based N management resulted in a significantly higher N use efficiency than the fix - schedule N management."
PH2001100474,The results suggest that tiller counting can substitute for the chlorophyll meter in determining the correct timing of N topdressing in irrigatedrice
CZ2001000341,Alluvial soils are considered as the most contaminated soils by risk trace elements.
CZ2001000341,"In this work , total content of Cd , Cr , Cu , Pb and Zn was determined."
CZ2001000341,Decomposition was carried out in the closed vessels with mixture of HNO3 ( 65 % ) and HCl ( 35 % ) acids in pressurized microwave oven PAAR ( Austria ).
CZ2001000341,The samples were taken form the soil profile in SZP Zabcice ( Fluvi - Eutric Gleysol ).
CZ2001000341,"Results obtained show that content of Cr , Cu , Pb and Zn is increasing with depth ( maximum 40 - 70 cm )."
CZ2001000341,Total content of Cu and Pb in the top soil ( Alp 0 - 15 cm ) is higher than average background concentration.
CZ2001000341,Total content of Cd was under detection limit.
CZ2001000341,The content of others risk trace elements represent typical average concentration for background.
CZ2001000335,Methods for setting the different levels of limit values for contents of potentially toxic substancess in soil are discussed.
CZ2001000335,"These levels are namely : background values , precautionary values , trigger values , clean - up values and target values."
CZ2001000335,In the Czech Republic the first level for legislation was proposed ( precautionary values ).
CZ2001000335,The second level ( trigger values ) are being tested and verified.
SK2001000204,The influence of selected climatic characteristics on the variability of winter rape ( Brassica napus L. ) seed yield was evaluated in a stationary field trial conducted in the Regional Research Institute of Agroecology Michalovce research station Vysoka nad Uhom during 1981/1999.
SK2001000204,The station is situated in the central part of the East Slovakian Lowland with continental character of climate.
SK2001000204,Statistical regression analysis showed that the sum of precipitations was a dominant source of variability of the winter rape yield followed by the sum of temperatures.
SK2001000204,The variations in sunshine were not related to the rape yield which indicated sufficient sunshine in the period of our investigations.
SK2001000204,Precipitations and temperatures were both usefully and harmfully excessive and harmfully insuficient during individual years and months.
SK2001000204,Increased intensity of manuring decreased the dependence of yield on the variability of weather parameters.
SK2001000204,The relationships observed under the real growing conditions indicate that different nutrition of crops results in different wintering abilities and different effectiveness of utilization of precipitations andtemperature
FR2000005023,"Pendant au moins deux ans , 72 cultivars et lignees de selection avancees de ble ont ete testees aux champs dans dix pays europeens pour evaluer la resistance a la rouille des feuilles."
FR2000005023,"De plus , la resistance a ete evaluee lors d'essais en laboratoire sur des plantules infectees avec des isolats de formules virulence / avirulence connues pour postuler des genes de resistance."

FR2000005023,Deux tiers des 72 entrees possedaient une resistance a l'etat adulte et / ou une resistance partielle.
FR2000005023,Les cultivars contenant le gene Lr13 ont montre des reactions tres differentes a la maladie ; il semble donc que le gene Lr13 seul ne procure pas une resistance d'un niveau suffisant en Europe.
FR2000005023,Le gene Lr37 a permis une bonne resistance des plantes au stade adulte tandis qu'au stade plantule une sensibilite moyenne a ete observee.

PH2001101521,"In the province of Ifugao , Northern Luzon , Philippine rice cultivation on irrigated terraces has been practiced since centuries ago."
PH2001101521,The traditional system is characterized by one harvest per year from permanently flooded fields.
PH2001101521,The macrophyte Najas graminea Del is the most abundant submerged wild plant in this agroecosystem.
PH2001101521,"It is argued that this plant can be seen as a keystone species , because of its crucial role in maintaining the organization and diversity of the aquatic community which also has impacts on the terrestrial community of the agroecosystem."
PH2001101521,"This conclusion was drawn from two aspects studied : ( 1 ) The food web of the aquatic community depends on the presence of N. graminea since it provides Aufwuchs and detritus , on the surfaces of its leaves , to primary consumers such as crustaceans , the larvae of Ephemeroptera and Chironomidae , and Gastropoda which in turn serve as prey for a number of predators , mainly the larvae of Odonata , certain Coleoptera and Diplonychus rusticus ( Fabricius )."

PH2001101521,"The golden snail Pomacea canaliculata ( Lamarck ) , a recent invader into Southeast Asian rice fields from tropical America and a serious pest of rice seedlings in modern production systems , caused no appreciable damage in the Ifugal rice terraces so far."
PH2001101521,The most probable explanation for that is the presence of a high biomass of wild aquatic plants mainly N. graminea and the floating ferns Azolla pinnata R. Br.
PH2001101521,which serve as alternative food sources for P. canaliculata when the rice plants are most vulnerable to its attacks.
PH2001101521,Comparison of snail fauna in different fields before and seven years after the invasion of P. canaliculata showed that it had no clear negative impacts on the native species.
PH2001101521,Possible future impacts of the species on the agroecosystem arediscussed
BE2002000635,"Germination and growth response of maize ( Zea mays ) that was periodically watered with 200 ml of leaf leachates of three selected multipurpose tree species ( MPTs ) - Inga edulis , Anthonatha macrophylla and Dactyladenia barterii were evaluated under a simulated field condition to determine their allolepathic characteristics and suitability for alley cropping."
BE2002000635,There was a significant ( P 0.05 ) difference in the germination percentage of the maize seeds among the MPTs studied.
BE2002000635,"Maximum germination percentage ( 76.7 / ) of the seeds and seedling growth as indicated by radicle length , shoot length , fresh weight and plant height at taselling were obtained from seeds watered / treated with rainwater as the control treatment."
BE2002000635,Reduction in germination percentage ( 33 / ) was observed in Anthonatha macrophylla leachates while moderate germination percentage of 50 / was observed in Dactyladenia barterii leachate.
BE2002000635,Anthonatha macrophylla leachate inhibited both radicle and shoot lenght.
BE2002000635,"Similarly , Inga edulis leachate had inhibiting effects on radicle and shoot of germinating maize seeds."
BE2002000635,"This result suggets that Inga edulis , Anthonatha macrophylla and Dactyladenia barterii produce allelochems which inhibit seed germination and growth of maize under the conditions of the experiment."
BE2002000635,Investigations on allelopathic characteristics of potential MPTs could be integrated in farm planning strategies in a tropical agroecology especially where alley cropping is contemplated.

AV20120116301,"The major objective of this study was to determine the relative importance of landscape factors , local abiotic factors , and biotic interactions in influencing tadpole community structure in temporary wetlands."
AV20120116301,I also examined the influence of agricultural activities in South - central Florida by comparing tadpole communities in native prairie wetlands ( a relatively unmodified habitat ) at the Kissimmee Prairie Sanctuary ( KPS ) to tadpole communities in three agriculturally modified habitats found at MacArthur Agro-Ecology Research Center ( MAERC ).
AV20120116301,"Environmental characteristics were measured in 24 isolated wetlands , and tadpoles were sampled using throw - traps and dipnets during the 1999 wet season ( Juneâ € “ October )."
AV20120116301,Landscape characteristics were expected to predominately influence all aspects of community structure because anurans associated with temporary wetland systems are likely to exist as metapopulations.
AV20120116301,Both landscape characteristics ( wetland proximity to nearest woodland and the amount of woodland surrounding the wetland ) and biotic interactions ( fish predation ) had the largest influence on tadpole community structure.
AV20120116301,"Predatory fish influenced tadpole communities more than expected due to the ubiquity of wetlands , lack of topographic relief , and dispersal abilities of several fish species."
AV20120116301,Differences in tadpole community structure among habitat types were attributed to differences in woodland attributes and susceptibility to fish colonization.
AV20120116301,"Furthermore , agricultural modification of prairie habitats in South - central Florida may benefit amphibian communities , particularly woodland - dwelling species that are unable to coexist with predatory fish."
AV20120116301,"From a conservation standpoint , temporary wetlands proximal to woodland areas and isolated from permanent water sources appear to be most important to amphibians."
AV20120116301,"In addition , the high tadpole densities attained in these wetlands suggest that these wetlands serve as biological hotspots within the landscape , and their benefits extend into the adjacent terrestrial matrix."
AV20120116301,Further research efforts are needed to quantify the biological productivity of these systems and determine spatial dynamics of anurans in surrounding terrestrial habitats.
TH2005000429,"This research is a comparative case study on rice farming technology and dynamics of the recent rice farming transitions under the agro-ecological , technological and socio - economical conditions."
TH2005000429,"The two rice - farming villages of this study were Ban Khoh in Ayutthaya province and Ban Khoh Rat in Nakhon Pathom province , representing the former and the more recent rice producing areas , respectively."
TH2005000429,"Qualitative research approach was employed , grounded on two conceptual frameworks : the Practical Technology Concept and the Agrarian Systems Concept."
TH2005000429,"Highlights of the findings were as follows : 1 ) In Ban Khoh of Ayutthaya province , wet - season rice farming was still predominant , depending on single cropping of floating rice."
TH2005000429,Traces of indigenous rice farming technology could be minimally observed.
TH2005000429,"Transitions to modern rice farming system had been gradual and limited , due to the constraints of the agro-ecology of the rice lands."
TH2005000429,Only a small number of full - time farmers existed.
TH2005000429,"2 ) On the contrary , Ban Khoh Rat of Nakhon Pathom province is an exemplary case of a rapid transition from traditional to a full - scale modern and commercial rice farming."
TH2005000429,Intensive all - year round rice farming system is predominant.
TH2005000429,"Notably , full - time farmers comprised the majority of the village households."
TH2005000429,"Factors contributing to this rapid transition phenomenon were : the government continuous export - oriented rice policy , farmers perceived benefits of intensive rice farming , advantage from the full - scale irrigation network , influx of the green revolution packages of technology , and the supporting culture and innovativeness of the farmers."
US2012205687,Farmers who live in fragile tropical hillsides often operate under severe resource constraints and face difficult tradeoffs when confronted with changes in production conditions.
US2012205687,"Using a bioeconomic linear programming model , this study simulates the effects of population , market , and technological changes on farmers income and on their management of the natural resource in a hillside area of Central Honduras.The results show that economic growth and agricultural intensification are not necessarily adverse for fragile environments."

GB2013202758,Contributed as part of the UK public consultation on GM it aims to assess the potential risks and benefits associated with the use of genetically modified ( GM ) crops in developing countries in relation to improving food security and economically valuable agriculture.
GB2013202758,"The authors draw on a variety of case studies from developing countries.The paper finds that : in particular cases , GM crops can contribute to substantial progress in improving agriculture in parallel to the inevitably slow changes at the socio - political level.the use of GM crops can , in some circumstances , have considerable potential to increase yields of crops , thereby improving agricultural practice and the livelihood of poor people in developing countries."
GB2013202758,"GM crops can be used to prevent environmental degradation , and to address specific ecological and agricultural problems which have proved less responsive to the standard tools of plant breeding and organic or conventional agricultural practices.there is an ethical obligation to explore these potential benefits responsibly , in order to contribute to the reduction of poverty , and to improve food security and economically valuable agriculturethere is not enough evidence of actual or potential harm to justify a moratorium on either research , field trials , or the controlled release of GM crops into the environment at this stage possible costs , benefits and risks associated with particular GM crops can only be assessed on a case by case basis."

SK2004000133,Polyfactorial field trials were realised in Milhostov on a FluviÃ » Eutric Gleysol ( very heavy clay soil ) and in Vysoka nad Uhom on an Eutric fluvisol ( middle heavy soil ).
SK2004000133,"Both localities are situated in the central part of the EastÃ » Slovakian Lowland , which can be characterised as very warm and dry to very dry climatic region."
SK2004000133,There were used conventional soil techniques with applications of manure ( beside variant V5 in field trial A ) and ground limestone ( 6 t / ha ).
SK2004000133,The forecrop was winter wheat.
SK2004000133,A variation of relation of sugar beet root yield and different agroclimatic factors was provided of two parallel field trials.
SK2004000133,There were observed five different nutrition variants ( V1 Ã » V5 ) and three variants of sowing distances in the rows ( 16Ã » 18Ã » 20 cm ) in the field trial A and this influence on the sugar beet root yield.
SK2004000133,The Adonis variety was used.
SK2004000133,"Nutrition variants : V1 Ã » nutrition correction during vegetative period on the basis of easy hydrolysing nitrogen in soil , V2 Ã » nutrition correction during vegetative period on the basis of inorganic plant analysis , V3 Ã » content of available nitrogen in soil completed on the dose of planned sugar beet root yield ( 40 t / ha ) , V4 Ã » doses of nutrients stated on the basis of the EUF ( electro - ultrafiltration ) method , V5 Ã » control non-fertilized variant."
SK2004000133,Nitrogen doses were calculated on the basis of available nitrogen balance in the soil ( to a depth of 600 mm ).
SK2004000133,The doses of phosphorus and potassium were calculated for the planned sugar beet root yield ( 40 t / ha ).
SK2004000133,In field trial B there was followed the root yield of nine sugar beet varieties at a constant nutrition level ( corresponding with the V4 variant in the trial A ) and the equal sowing distance in the rows 18 cm apart.
SK2004000133,"Five varieties were resistant towards the rhizomania ( varieties : Adela , Monriz , Flair , Ibiza , Formula ) and other were proved to be sensitive ( varieties : Intera , Olympus , Adonis , Kredo )."
SK2004000133,Over the threeÃ » year field trial average sugar beet root yield was found to be 64.26 t / ha in trial A and 68.70 t / ha in trial B. Statistical analysis confirmed the evident influence of nutrition on the variability of sugar Ã » beetroot yield in trial A. Nutrition was the source of 85.07 % yield variability.
SK2004000133,Soil type had a stronger influence on the yield than sowing distance in the rows.
SK2004000133,The meteorological conditions as an individual factor had statistically lower influence on the yield in comparison with their interaction with soil type.
SK2004000133,The participation of other interactions was relatively low despite statistical significance.
SK2004000133,In trial B there was ascertained an evident influence of soil type on the sugar beet root yield for the followed varieties.
SK2004000133,The individual variety was registered as the fourth factor in order of factors.
SK2004000133,In this case the influence of meteorological conditions was more important.
SK2004000133,"On the other hand , meteorological conditions as individual factor had stronger influence than their interaction with soil type."

GB2013202653,This paper critically reviews the concept and vision of ecoagriculture and the initiative of Ecoagriculture Partners.
GB2013202653,"The paper points out that supporters of Ecoagriculture ( ECOAG ) adhere to two pervasive but flawed assumptions : ( a ) that alternatives to a chemically - based crop production system necessarily require more land to produce the same amount of output and ( b ) that the adverse ecological and health consequences of industrial farming are minor in comparison to those that would be wrought by expansion of land extensive production systems.ECOAG , the study argues , has a profound negative ecological and health and social impacts : monoculture systems , lacking in functional biodiversity and self regulatory mechanisms , are genetically homogenous and species poor systems that are very vulnerable to diseases and pest outbreaksdue to this increased vulnerability a large quantity of pesticides has to be applied bringing enourmous environmental and health costsECOAG indirectly promotes the use of agrochemicals and GMOs the real causes of hunger are poverty , inequality and lack of access to food and land , and not necessarily the lack of production ; and as most methods of production intensification ( also those proposed by ECOAG ) deepen inequalities , they will fail to reduce hunger.The study concludes that without further endangering the natural environment depends upon public support for high - yield , sustainable agriculture research , education and extension."

GB2013202632,Promoting sustainable development in Sub-Saharan Africa ( SSA ) will require massive increases in the amounts of fertilisers used in agriculture.
GB2013202632,"Beyond Africa , history has shown that increases in fertiliser adoption are the starting blocks to long - term structural transformation and growth of the economy , and there is a widely held view that farmersâ € ™ failure to intensify agricultural production in a manner that maintains soil productivity is a key feature of SSAâ € ™ s land degradation problems."
GB2013202632,"This commissioned paper reviews the substantial body of fertiliser literature and attempts to provide a balanced view to the policy options available regarding fertiliser subsidies for smallholder agriculture in SSA.Although there are some differences , the paper reports that most of the literature agrees that enabling conditions for rapid fertiliser adoption include : increased investment in transportation and marketingbetter extension services and extension messagescost - effective means to reduce the risks of using fertilizer and producing for the marketfacilitation of rural financial markets for the financing of fertiliser purchasesResearchers and practitioners increasingly appreciate that complementary interventions must accompany fertiliser promotion programmes , and that these must explicitly regard improvements in land husbandry practices , the type of fertiliser recommended , and methods of application."
GB2013202632,"SSA boasts an extremely wide variety of specific circumstances , andthe paper emphasises disaggregated research , extension , and market development , and to take into consideration issues of institutional capacity , agro-ecology , and population densities."
GB2013202632,"General lessons for better programme design should only be drawn where the scale of the synthesis and generalisation is at the national level or below.Fertiliser subsidies remain an attractive option ; they are politically appealing and seem easy to implement , despite past negative externalities."
GB2013202632,"The current debate on subsidies focuses on ways to improve targeting , and that fertiliser promotion programmes are considered explicitly in relation to a range of alternative investments and policy tools."
GB2013202632,"Soil fertility decline can only be combated with increased donor resources , which will lead to local benefits as well as supra - national benefits , such as increased carbon sequestration.Despite the substantial literature available , significant gaps remain in our knowledge of soil fertility , fertiliser response and profitability , and social costs and benefits , among others."

CH2005000163,Starting point The commercial cultivation of genetically modified plants ( GMPs ) in Switzerland seems to be rather unlikely in the foreseeable future.
CH2005000163,"Since Swiss farmers and consumers might one day become interested in GMPs with specific properties , however , the future cultivation of such crops can not entirely be ruled out."
CH2005000163,The new Gene Technology Law ( GTL ) stipulates that protection of GM - free production and consumers _ freedom of choice must be guaranteed if GMPs are to be grown in Switzerland.
CH2005000163,"This _ co-existence _ would have to be ensured by regulations , as well as by technical and organisational measures to separate the flow of goods throughout the entire production chain from field to supermarket shelf."
CH2005000163,What is co-existence?
CH2005000163,"The term _ co-existence _ implies that various GM and non-GM crop production systems can exist alongside one another , and that no individual form of agricultural production is excluded a priori."
CH2005000163,"In its recommendations on co-existence , the European Commission defines the term as the ability of farmers to choose the production systems and crops of their preference."
CH2005000163,The term also refers to the potential economic loss associated with the undesirable presence of genetically modified material in so - called _ GM - free _ agricultural products.
CH2005000163,"However , the term is not employed in connection with risks associated with genetically modified crops and their possible effects on human health and the environment."
CH2005000163,"Goals and limitations of this study In view of the Federal Council_s official statement on the initiative _ For GM - free Food _ put forward by environmental , consumer and farmer associations , Agroscope FAL Reckenholz _ the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology and Agriculture _ was commissioned by the Federal Office for Agriculture ( FOAG ) in December 2003 to evaluate possible measures allowing GM and non-GM agriculture to co-exist in Switzerland."
CH2005000163,The initial phase of our work consisted in analysing mechanisms that could lead to a mixing of agricultural products during crop production.
CH2005000163,"Subsequently , we investigated the measures that could be taken to minimise or prevent such mixing."
CH2005000163,"Using the three crops of maize , wheat and oilseed rape , our study demonstrates the technical and organisational measures that must be taken during agricultural production in order to ensure the cultivation of both GM and non-GM crops."
CH2005000163,"The co-existence scenario we formulated was based on a co-existence study conduc - ted by the European Commission ( Bock et al. 2002 ) , as well as on a study of the situation in Denmark ( Tolstrup et al. 2003 )."
CH2005000163,"Our study is confined to agricultural production , from the crop - planning phase to delivery of the harvest by the farmer."
CH2005000163,The costs of co-existence and the potential for separating the flow of goods during the processing and marketing phases are not covered by this study.
PK2008000595,The effects of exogenous abscisic acid ( ABA ) application on the antioxidant defenses were investigated in grass pea ( Lathyrus sativus L. ) seedlings.
PK2008000595,"Four treatment combinations of ABA ( 1x10 - 3 nM ABA ) and PEG ( 10 % polyethylene glycol , PEG 6000 ) were designed to evaluate their short - term ( 48 h ) effect : ( 1 ) Well - watered group ( Control group1 ) , ( 2 ) PEG treatment , ( 3 ) ABA treatment , and ( 4 ) PEG + ABA treatment."
PK2008000595,"In addition , 2 other treatments were used to evaluate the long - term ( 15 d ) effect of ABA : well - watered group ( Control group2 ) and ABA treatment."
PK2008000595,"Time - course analyses of ABA content , the production of malondialdehyde ( MDA ) and H2O2 , and the activities of superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) , glutathione reductase ( GR ) and peroxidase ( POD ) in water - stressed leaves showed that a significant increase in ABA content preceded that of MDA and H2O2 in long term experiment , which was followed by a substantial increase in the activities of four antioxidant enzymes."
PK2008000595,"Under the short - term drought stress , ABA application promoted the activities of antioxidant enzymes , and reduced the accumulation of MDA and H2O2 significantly."
PK2008000595,"On the contrary , long - term application of exogenous ABA increases the generation of MDA and H2O2 significantly."
PK2008000595,"It could be argued that during a successive application of exogenous ABA , ABA played a dual role by which the beneficial role in the initial stage shifted to a detrimental one under prolonged treatment in up - regulating protective defense strategies in plants."
PH2007001717,Sweet potato is commonly grown in upland or hilly areas where it serves not only as a food source for farm families but also as an additional source of income.
PH2007001717,"The municipality of Castilla , situated in the highland of Sorsogon , is a potential area for growing sweetpotato."
PH2007001717,"However , there is no suitable production of sweetpotato in the province."
PH2007001717,One reason noted was the lack of appropriate planting materials suitable to the local conditions.
PH2007001717,"Thus , there is a need to introduce and produce other traditional cultivars , which are not only high yielding but suited to local conditions."
PH2007001717,"To evaluate and characterize traditional varieties found in La Union , Castilla , Sorsogon , Lasim et al. conducted a varietal collection and evaluation of traditional sweetpotato ( Ipomoea batatas ) varieties in 2003 - 2005."
PH2007001717,' Inaswang ' significantly produced the longest vines ( 218.6 m ) in the upland agroecology and 197.2 m in the sloping agroecology.
PH2007001717,This could be attributed to the growth habit of the plant.

PH2007001717,Only Buko - buko 2 was moderately resistant to weevil infestation in the sloping agroecology.
PH2007001717,Sinorsoganon and Soraw were potential varieties for planting in both seasons ( dry and wet ) and locations ( upland and sloping ).

CZ2006000489,The aim of this study was to compare the differential response of yield components of two old and two new soybean cultivars to the assimilate availability at an early reproductive stage of growth under light enriched conditions.
CZ2006000489,The yield sensitivity was much greater in old than in new cultivars.
CZ2006000489,"The yield of the new cultivars was more likely sink - limited , whereas it was source - limited for the old cultivars."
CZ2006000489,The increased yield by light enrichment was in part due to an increased branch contribution.
CZ2006000489,Pod number per plant was more responsive than seed number per pod.
CZ2006000489,The reduction in pod number by source - sink manipulation was more severe in the old cultivars.
CZ2006000489,Light enrichment increased pod number only in the two old cultivars.
CZ2006000489,Seed size was responsive to changes in the source - sink ratio and changes in the environment.
CZ2006000489,Both pod number or seed size may be increased or decreased if environmental conditions for seed filling are altered.

DJ2012083312,The results have been able to identify botanical attributes for species differentiation and useful agronomic attributes in the wild rice species as genetic resources both for the improvement of O. sativa and possibly some of the wild species per se.
DJ2012083312,"These attributes include : insensitivity to photoperiod , long grains , awnlessness , dense panicle , high yield parameters , high food value and tillering habit."
DJ2012083312,Findings also revealed considerable variability in the gene pool of the species studied for the improvement of the rice crop.
GB2013203320,"Biofuels ( or agrofuels ) production has increased dramatically in Latin America over recent years , as global concern over climate change grows and oil prices continue to rise."
GB2013203320,"But are biofuels really a sustainable energy solution , and what are the costs?"
GB2013203320,"This publication is the result of a seminar on the expansion of sugarcane plantations in Latin America , which took place in So Paulo , Brazil in February 2007."

FR2014001803,""" Ecologization "" is the word chosen by the Ecodevelopment , a French multi-disciplinary research unit , to qualify the current trend of European Union agricultural and rural policies and its effects on agricultural production systems."
FR2014001803,Two main research programs have been identified.
FR2014001803,"The first analyzes the process itself , the gradual extension of the sphere of agricultural and rural activities affected by environmentally oriented policies : from the periphery to the core of the agricultural sector , from limited agri - environmental rules to cross compliance."
FR2014001803,The second examines the process of designing new agricultural production models aimed at fulfilling these new obligations.
FR2014001803,"In the first part of the presentation , examples of social science research are developed , focusing on biodiversity conservation , the alternative between considering environmental demands as constraints or at the contrary opportunities for inventing an ecologically based agricultural production , and the consequences of these policies on social equity for farmers and consumers.The second part of the presentation examines the empirical results at the light of three theoretical streams of environmental social sciences : Ecological Modernization , Treadmill of Production and Political Ecology."
FR2014001803,The heuristic value and the limits of each of these theoretical approaches are identified.
FR2014001803,"Ecological Modernization is valued for its assessment of innovations in the production and production / consumption systems , but can be questioned on the assertion of the capacity of the capitalist production system to internalize by itself ecologization demands."
FR2014001803,"Treadmill of Production is valued for its interest for the leading part of social movements in building local and global alternative production and consumption systems , but is weaker when taking into account the development of ecologization in public policies."
FR2014001803,"Political Ecology is valued for its focus on the institutions that convey the policies of ecologization and on the nature of institutional changes that they generate , but is weaker in its analyses of the roots of ecological crises and on the assessment of the technical innovations promoted by these institutions.In conclusion , the relevance of choosing the world "" ecologization "" is discussed as compared with other terms which are propound to designate the trend of European Union agricultural policy : "" greening "" , "" multi-functionality "" , "" sustainable agricultural development"""
CZ2008000437,The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the performance of selected populations of cotton after four cycles of recurrent mass selection.
CZ2008000437,"These populations were evaluated along with 2 commercial checks , STAM 18 A and H -279-1 , and the original population AGP 0 at five locations , Angaradebou , Mone , Savalou , Okpara in the Republic of Benin , and in the location Samaru in Nigeria."
CZ2008000437,The trials were carried out during two years.
CZ2008000437,"In comparison with the average of the local checks , the farmers made significant improvement in population density , days to boll opening , seed cotton yield and seed index."

DJ2012088296,"But , what considerable processes are being carried out by the university or by regional institutions that , from this challenge , consider themselves as a contributor to the endogenous development of our zone?"
DJ2012088296,"How many agronomical engineers , agroecologists and / or university professionals are involved in these processes?"
DJ2012088296,"And , how many and which are the replicated , published and / or involved experiences that generate bases in this process?"
DJ2012088296,"One of the guarantees in this development is to involve the local capital , local resources , and people from the zone , without imposing policies that favor external agents , in order to guarantee a proper growth , a supply of local work and a model of endogenous development that allows the economic growth of our own communities."
DJ2012088296,"But the challenge lies here , in the consolidation of sectors without particular but common interests , that focus their work to the own fortification and local development , before thinking about external sales , exports and markets of â € œlights and colorsâ € , that do not leave a true surplus to a community that looks for its development."

SK2008000036,The aim of this work was to show the development of physical properties of clay - loamy soil at various tillage practices.
SK2008000036,Treatments were carried out in 1998 - 2006 in Milhostov on heavy Gleyic Fluvisol ( FMG ).
SK2008000036,"This experimental locality is situated in central part of the East - Slovakian Lowland , approximately at an altitude of 101 m. For this locality the continental climate is typical."
SK2008000036,"Gleyic Fluvisol is characterized as a clay - loamy soil , heavy soil with the average content of clay elements higher than 53 %."
SK2008000036,This soil is slightly leaching in the whole profile.
SK2008000036,The topsoil has a lump aggregate structure with a high binding ability.
SK2008000036,A coherent layer of grey clay is usually in the depth of 0.8 m.
SK2008000036,The field treatments were realized without irrigation.
SK2008000036,"Two soil tillage technologies were examined ( PS - no - tillage technology , i.e. direct sowing without tillage , KA - conventional tillage , i.e. current way of soil tillage by ploughing )."
SK2008000036,Field plants were arranged into a crop rotation as follows : clover - grass mixtures 2nd crop year - clover - grass mixture 3rd crop year - grain maize - field bean - winter wheat - soya bean - winter wheat - grain maize - spring barley.
SK2008000036,Soil samples were taken in spring since April to May.
SK2008000036,"Physical soil parameters ( bulk density , total porosity , maximum capillary capacity , available water capacity , non-capillary porosity , point of decreased availability ) were determined in these soil samples."
SK2008000036,"Obtained data were tested by statistical methods , especially by variance analysis."
SK2008000036,An increase in bulk density at no - tillage variant in comparison with conventional tillage variant was determined.
SK2008000036,With this result the decrease of total porosity in variant with direct sowing without ploughing corresponds.
SK2008000036,"Tillage system , mainly conventional tillage , affected maximum capillary capacity significantly."
SK2008000036,Available water capacity did not show any differences between variants with different soil preparation and its values 7.07 - 25.88 % suggest a significant dependence of this soil parameter on the content of clay particles.
SK2008000036,In the average during the nine - year experimental period the less non-capillary pores were determined on variant with conventional tillage ( D = 0.25 % ) and the decrease in total porosity at no - tillage systems was not found out.
SK2008000036,Tillage practice of clay - loamy soil had statistically significant effect on bulk density and total porosity.

IR2008000646,"For this purpose a relatively small pilot area was selected , consisting of 4 sub-basins located in the Aras and the Daryacheh - Oromieh basins of Eastern Azarbaijan Province , North West Iran , covering about 32,000 km2."
IR2008000646,"This area has been selected for ( i ) its convenient location in the near neighbourhood of the DARI Headquarters in Maragheh , facilitating field work , ground truthing and institutional support , and ( ii ) its tremendous ecological diversity , making it representative for large areas in Iran , and allowing widespread application of the methods detailed in this report."
IR2008000646,"The study has two major components , an agroecological characterization of the pilot area , followed by a classification of suitability for eight crops ( barley , wheat , lentil , chickpea , olive , potato , sugar beet , and safflower )."
IR2008000646,All results are provided in the form of maps ( a total of 108 ) with table and text summaries.
IR2008000646,"The methods used are fully described in the main text , with annexes where more detailed explanations are necessary , to allow their replication in other parts of the country."
IR2008000646,"The characterization part of this report includes descriptions of the characteristics and mapping of the patterns of precipitation , temperature , frost , potential evapotranspiration , aridity , climatic productivity indicators , growing periods , land use / land cover , landforms , soils and agroecological zones."
IR2008000646,A special section is dedicated to the use of a method of climatic similarity analyses to detect the degree of similarity between a selected location and each part of the study area.
IR2008000646,This kind of mapping is particularly useful to identify in which areas technologies developed at research stations are most likely to succeed as a result of ecological similarity with these stations.
IR2008000646,"In the land evaluation part of the report the results of the suitability assessment for the selected crops are mainly presented in the form of maps that indicate suitability of the individual factors , moisture and temperature regime , climate , topography and the suitability from the integration of all factors in the form of percentages of the suitability classes & lsquohighly suitable & rsquo , & lsquomoderately suitable & rsquo , & lsquomarginally suitable & rsquoand & lsquonon - suitable & rsquo."
IR2008000646,"Few datasets were used in this study , yet they are the basis for the large range of maps that have been generated."
IR2008000646,"The basic data , from which all other datasets are derived , are climatic data ( precipitation and temperature ) , a land use / land cover map , a digital elevation model and a soil map."
IR2008000646,It can therefore be concluded that with a relatively limited and widely available dataset a good knowledge can be obtained of the agroecology and crop suitabilities in different parts of Iran.
IR2008000646,"One severe limitation , which has restricted the optimal use of the land suitability methods , is the lack of sufficiently detailed soil information."
IR2008000646,"New approaches , making optimal use of already existing primary and secondary information , are necessary to improve the results by making them more soil - specific."

 ,Farmers in the Sahelian part of West Africa are facing yield - limiting factors affecting household capabilities of securing food security in a rapidly growing population.
 ,"The main concern in the region is to find potential ways to alleviate the low soil fertility problem in a way that is cost effective , environmentally friendly and making investment opportunities possible."
 ,The Ecofarming project developed two types of fertilizer microdosage systems that underwent testing in both mono cropping and intercropping systems.
 ,"The specific objective of this study was to investigate the present socio - economical situation of farmers involved in the project , study the effects of fertilizer application on crop yields and to evaluate the potential economical gain from adopting these microdosage systems."
 ,The study area was in the region of Mopti in Mali.
 ,The sampling method used was convenience sampling.
 ,Structured questionnaire was employed to collect data.
 ,The results show that farmers have all necessary requirements to intensify their agricultural system.
 ,"In mono cropping , farmers can expect to have good crop yields when adopting the technique of applying fertilizer 15 days after seed planting."
 ,"However , this technique has shown to be costly for farmers to adopt , and is economically not suitable at an early stage."
 ,"Alternatively , a single change application of fertilizer in ratio 1:1 can give a profit of more than 300 %."
 ,"In intercropping farmers can improve their crop yields when adopting the technique of applying fertilizer in ratio 1:1 , with soaked seeds of millet intercropped with cowpeas , and pesticide use."
 ,"However , farmers in Koro were unsuccessful to obtain important yields like their counterparts in Bankass."
 ,Farmers in Bankass can obtain 300 % benefit from changing from a more traditional farming system to the application of micro-fertilization without the use of any pesticide alone.
 ,"Micro-fertilization techniques remarkably increase crop yields , which can help farmers securing their consumption and investment possibilities , and at the same time intensifying their agricultural system."
FR2013104489,"Although it has often been the cornerstone of integrated pest management ( IPM ) programs , an approach based on crop host - plant resistance ( HPR ) alone shows limitations , unless it takes into account upper scale levels than the mere plant or field , namely the agroecosystem or the landscape levels , in view of achieving sustainable HPR."
FR2013104489,"On the other hand , agroecology , which is based on the enhancement of bioecological processes in agriculture can help achieve , beyond mere HPR , an actual sustainable agroecosystem resistance to pests."
FR2013104489,This approach is illustrated with examples taken from the development and implementation of options following this approach for the management of sorghum panicle pests in West and Central Africa.
FR2013104489,We firstly undertook bioecological studies on mirid panicle - feeding bugs which have recently become major pests of improved short - cycled compact - headed sorghum cultivars in this region.
FR2013104489,"These studies demonstrated the role of these pests as factors increasing grain mould infection , how they were affected by weather factors , and established the existence of alternate hosts."
FR2013104489,"Then , multi-local tests improved our knowledge of the relationships ( in terms of damage ) between a set of sorghum cultivars and these pests , while laboratory studies put forward a likely cause of sorghum resistance to mirid bugs , namely quicker endosperm hardening."
FR2013104489,"Meanwhile , we investigated the genetic bases of these resistances , both by quantitative genetics and molecular methods."
FR2013104489,"Lastly , crosses were made which ultimately resulted in the release of sorghum cultivar CIRAD 441 which combines resistance to both sorghum midge and panicle - feeding bugs with desirable agronomic traits."
FR2013104489,"On the other hand , the results of a study on on - farm experimental designs suggested that panicle - feeding bug infestation and damage was not only influenced by sorghum genotype , but also field size , and its genotypic environment , namely the vicinity of other farmers ' fields of pest - susceptible or - resistant cultivars , and the relative positions of these fields."
FR2013104489,On - farm trials demonstrated that castor bean was an alternate host and a significant source of sorghum infestation by panicle - feeding bugs.
FR2013104489,"This led to the prospect of reducing pest damage by management of castor beans ( by destruction of its spikes before sorghum flowering , and / or using it as a trap crop after sorghum maturity )."
FR2013104489,"These results are placed in perspective with observations on other pests of sorghum in the region , and on other crops and / or other tropical regions , which also call for an agroecological approach to crop pest management for sustainable food production."

FR2014012229,"Yet significant declines have been reported for wild bee populations and honey bee colonies alike in Europe.We quantified the relative importance of autonomous self - pollination , wind pollination and the pollination service provided by insects in annual entomophilous field crops over 7 to 10 sites located over a gradient of increasing semi-natural habitats in five pairs of crop - European country ( ALARM EU project ) : buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum in Poland , cantaloupe Cucumis melo in France , field bean Vicia faba in the UK , spring oilseed rape Brassica napus in Sweden , and strawberry Fragaria x ananassa in Germany."
FR2014012229,"Pollination service was measured on a whole plant basis , rather than using flower samples , so as to have direct access to yield data as well the quality and value of the production."

IR2012052127,"Agroecological zones are integrated spatial units in which available water resources , climate , terrain , and soil conditions combine to create unique environments , associated with distinct farming systems and land - use and settlement patterns."
IR2012052127,An agroecological zones ( AEZ ) map is an essential tool for agricultural planning.
IR2012052127,"By integrating the key components of the agricultural environments , it offers a bird - eye view of internal diversity , agricultural potential and constraints that decision - makers find easier to understand than a pile of single - theme maps."
IR2012052127,"In this study , AEZ map of karkheh river basin have been created using climate data covering the period 1973 - 1998 , land use , land cover and landforms / soils implemented in GIS."

CZ2008000355,"The effect of two different nitrogen sources , ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate , applied at increased rates , on the content of the total N , protein and non-protein N , and the content and composition of amino acids in head cabbage leaves was studied."
CZ2008000355,"Ammonium nitrate fertilization led to higher N accumulation than the use of calcium nitrate , but the application of Ca ( NO3 ) 2 resulted in a higher content of nitrate N."
CZ2008000355,More protein N was also observed in plants with Ca ( NO3 ) 2 fertilization.
CZ2008000355,The highest applied fertilizer rate of ammonium nitrate resulted in a significant reduction of the protein N.
CZ2008000355,The total content of amino acids increased gradually with the increase of N rates in plants fertilized with NH4NO3.
CZ2008000355,"When Ca ( NO3 ) 2 was applied , N rates higher than 500 mg / kg soil suppressed the synthesis of amino acids."
CZ2008000355,"A greater increase was observed as regards the levels of arginine , proline and some essential amino acids as lysine , phenylalanine and histidine."
CZ2008000355,The increase of proline and alanine could serve as an indicator for unbalanced N nutrition.
BG2008000564,Agroecology is an important part of the aqui communitaire and during the last few years it gains more importance for the Common agricultural policy.
BG2008000564,Since 2007 the development of the agricultural branch in Bulgaria continued under the conditions of Bulgarias real membership.
BG2008000564,"Together with the increasing financial support that the Bulgarian growers obtain as direct subsidies , market support and funds for the development of rural areas , their integration within the Community market demands a lot efforts to follow the good and modern European practices , norms and standards for production of high - quality , harmless for the users and competitive produce."
BG2008000564,Biological agriculture is nominated as a pilot agroecological activity within the framework of the agroecological measure here.
BG2008000564,Despite this Bulgaria marked significant delay in comparison to other European countries experienced in biological produce.
BG2008000564,"A number of reasons could be pointed out the most important of which are : breaking the principles of this type of produce , infringement of rules at building up organic farm , lack of knowledge of the specifics of this strictly regulated system of farms , insufficient using the opportunities for biological produce funding , etc Despite the on - going problems at realization of agroecological activities at plant - growing , the biological produce in Bulgaria is in process of development and turns to be a , winning strategy for every modern farm."
QM2008000032,Land degradation in the form of soil erosion and nutrient depletion presents a threat to food security and sustainability of agricultural production in many developing countries.
QM2008000032,Governments and development agencies have invested substantial resources to promote soil conservation practices as part of an effort to improve environmental conditions and reduce poverty.
QM2008000032,"However , limited rigorous empirical work has been done on the economics of soil conservation technology adoption."
QM2008000032,"This article investigates the impact of stone bunds on value of crop production per hectare in low and high rainfall areas of the Ethiopian highlands using cross-sectional data from more than 900 households , with multiple plots per household."
QM2008000032,"We have used modified random effects models , stochastic dominance analysis ( SDA ) , and matching methods to ensure robustness."
QM2008000032,The parametric regression and SDA estimates are based on matched observations obtained from the nearest neighbor matching using propensity score estimates.
QM2008000032,"This is important , because conventional regression and SDA estimates are obtained without ensuring that there actually exist comparable conserved and nonconserved plots on the distribution of covariates."
QM2008000032,"We use matching methods , random effects , and Mundlak 's approach to control selection and endogeneity bias that may arise due to correlation of unobserved heterogeneity and observed explanatory variables."
QM2008000032,We find that the three methods tell a consistent story.
QM2008000032,"Plots with stone bunds are more productive than those without such technologies in semi-arid areas but not in higher rainfall areas , apparently because the moisture conserving benefits of this technology are more beneficial in drier areas."
QM2008000032,"This implies that the performance of stone bunds varies by agro-ecology type , suggesting the need for designing and implementing appropriate site - specific technologies."
QM2008000037,Serum enzymes were studied in 377 apparently healthy sheep from three indigenous sheep breeds of Ethiopia.
QM2008000037,"The effect of breed , age , sex and season on alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) / glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( GPT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) / glutamic oxalacetic transaminase ( GOT ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and acid phosphatase ( AcP ) levels was assessed."
QM2008000037,"The mean serum enzymes levels of the indigenous Menz , Tukur and Wello sheep breeds ranged from 17.2 - 17.7 IU l - 1 , AST / GOT from 50.4 - 56.6 IU l - 1 , ALP from 93.2 - 103.9 IU l - 1 , and AcP from 2.47 - 2.56 IU l - 1 , were within the normal range for sheep elsewhere."
QM2008000037,Season had significant influence on all serum enzymes except for the AcP in Menz breed.
QM2008000037,"Sex had significant effect on AST / GOT for Menz and on ALP for all sheep breeds , with consistently higher values in males than in females."
QM2008000037,Age was significant only on ALP in the Menz and Tukur breeds.
QM2008000037,The serum enzyme levels of these indigenous sheep breeds can be used as normal reference values for Ethiopian sheep breeds adapted to similar agro-ecology and production system.
FR2019128544,"Although it has often been the cornerstone of integrated pest management ( IPM ) programs , an approach based on crop host - plant resistance ( HPR ) alone shows limitations , unless it takes into account upper scale levels than the mere plant or field , namely the agroecosystem or the landscape levels , in view of achieving sustainable HPR."
FR2019128544,"On the other hand , agroecology , which is based on the enhancement of bioecological processes in agriculture can help achieve , beyond mere HPR , an actual sustainable agroecosystem resistance to pests."
FR2019128544,This approach is illustrated with examples taken from the development and implementation of options following this approach for the management of sorghum panicle pests in West and Central Africa.
FR2019128544,We firstly undertook bioecological studies on mirid panicle - feeding bugs which have recently become major pests of improved short - cycled compact - headed sorghum cultivars in this region.
FR2019128544,"These studies demonstrated the role of these pests as factors increasing grain mould infection , how they were affected by weather factors , and established the existence of alternate hosts."
FR2019128544,"Then , multi-local tests improved our knowledge of the relationships ( in terms of damage ) between a set of sorghum cultivars and these pests , while laboratory studies put forward a likely cause of sorghum resistance to mirid bugs , namely quicker endosperm hardening."
FR2019128544,"Meanwhile , we investigated the genetic bases of these resistances , both by quantitative genetics and molecular methods."
FR2019128544,"Lastly , crosses were made which ultimately resulted in the release of sorghum cultivar CIRAD 441 which combines resistance to both sorghum midge and panicle - feeding bugs with desirable agronomic traits."
FR2019128544,"On the other hand , the results of a study on on - farm experimental designs suggested that panicle - feeding bug infestation and damage was not only influenced by sorghum genotype , but also field size , and its genotypic environment , namely the vicinity of other farmers ' fields of pest - susceptible or - resistant cultivars , and the relative positions of these fields."
FR2019128544,On - farm trials demonstrated that castor bean was an alternate host and a significant source of sorghum infestation by panicle - feeding bugs.
FR2019128544,"This led to the prospect of reducing pest damage by management of castor beans ( by destruction of its spikes before sorghum flowering , and / or using it as a trap crop after sorghum maturity )."
FR2019128544,"These results are placed in perspective with observations on other pests of sorghum in the region , and on other crops and / or other tropical regions , which also call for an agroecological approach to crop pest management for sustainable food production."
RU2009000092,The genotoxicity of Pb and Cd for the spring soft wheat variety Voroneshskaya 6 was tested in greenhouse trials.
RU2009000092,The protective function of presowing seed treatment by potassium humate ( PH ) was also done.
RU2009000092,"Pb and Cd were introduced in the form of their nitro - acid salts at a dose of Cd - 30 and 50 , Pb - 200 and 750 milli g per soil kg at tumbler filling by sod - podzol loamy soil."
RU2009000092,The seeds were treated by PH - containing preparation Agrospej ( the Russian Federation ) at a dose of 0.6 ml per seed kg.
RU2009000092,The analysis of chromosome aberrations in intercalary meristems of apical point was made at the beginning of the leaf - tube formation plant stage.
RU2009000092,It showed that Cd led to the rise of abberant cell rate ( ACR ) in 1.6 and 1.8 times depending on the dose.
RU2009000092,The presowing seed incrustation by PH decreased ACR till background meanings 11.00 and 13.52 % at the control meanings of 12.25 and 13.72 % ).
RU2009000092,The ACR dependence on a dose was not marked for the trial variants with Pb soil contamination ( 17.3 and 18.25 ).
RU2009000092,"The rate increase of cytogenetic disruptions was 1.4 and 1.5 times , but it had a statistical importance only at a dose of 750 milli g per kg that was probably connected with less Pb absorption by the plants and higher soil buffer capacity for the element in compare with Cd."
RU2009000092,The treatment by PH decreased disruption level in 1.5 times till 12.01 %.
RU2009000092,The ratio of a total aberration number to total aberrant cell number changed insignificantly depending on the trial variants.
RU2009000092,The same case was also fixed in relation to a plant height and its dynamics and the most of productivity components.
RU2009000092,The exception was the variant with treatment by PH at the Cd contamination at a dose of 30 milli g per kg where grain weight of a plant fell down ( from 1.22 g to 0.84 g in compare with the control variant ).
RU2009000092,The conclusion was made that the growth regulator PH modified heavy metal genotoxic action decreasing chromosome disruptions without phytotoxic effect reducing.
RU2009000130,"Grain contamination by 4 types of fusariotoxins was studied : by T - 2 toxins ( T - 2 ) , 8 - oxotrichotecens of the 4 desoxynivalenol group ( DON ) , zearalenons and fumonisins of the B group ( FUM )."
RU2009000130,"The samples of maize and rice were chosen in the grain harvested in 2002 - 2006 on the territory of South , Volga and Central Federal Districts."

GB2013201967,"Sustainable agricultural practices , in as far as they rely on renewable local or farm resources , present desirable options for enhancing agricultural productivity for resource - constrained farmers in developing countries."
GB2013201967,"In this paper , we used two sets of plot - level dataâ € ” from a low - rainfall area and from a high - rainfall area of Ethiopiaâ € ” to investigate the impact of sustainable agricultural practices on crop productivity , with a particular focus on reduced tillage."
GB2013201967,"Specifically , we sought to investigate whether reduced tillage results in more or less productivity gains than chemical fertilizer."
GB2013201967,The nature of the two sets of data allows us to examine whether the productivity of these technologies is conditioned by agro-ecology.
GB2013201967,"Interestingly , our results revealed a clear superiority of reduced tillage over chemical fertilizers in enhancing crop productivity in the low - rainfall region."
GB2013201967,"In the high - rainfall region , however , chemical fertilizer is overwhelmingly superior and reduced tillage potentially results in productivity losses."
GB2013201967,"Thus , our results underscore the need to understand the role of agro-ecology in determining the profitability ( in terms of productivity gains ) of farm technologies."
GB2013201967,This has particular importance in formulating policies that promote technology adoption.
GB2013201967,"In this particular case , our results support encouraging resource - constrained farmers in semi-arid areas to adopt sustainable agricultural practices , especially since they enable farmers to reduce production costs , provide environmental benefits , andâ € ” as our results confirmâ € ” enhance crop productivity."

DJ2012089137,Participation is a research method that lets communities adopt tools and procedures for control and autonomy in workersâ € ™ self - management processes oriented towards agroecology.
DJ2012089137,"This implies going beyond the productive and technical management of agroecosystems , in order to build peasant organization forms."
DJ2012089137,"However , in relation to the diverse manners in which peasants participate in researches , different participation levels are reached , some of which do not represent methodological options or alternatives for the construction of local power and the configuration of social and political actors ; instead their participation is circumscribed to manual and functional activities that partially involve the producers."
DJ2012089137,"From this point of view , it is necessary to identify the real participation levels that configure the research methods , starting from the institutional interests and purposes proposed , the role of peasant researchers and external agents active in the research process , and up to what point is it possible to achieve community organization and workersâ € ™ self - management that donâ € ™ t necessarily respond to this purpose."
FR2014012809,Agroecology involves various approaches to solve actual challenges of agricultural production.
FR2014012809,"Though agroecology initially dealtprimarily with crop production and protection aspects , in recent decades new dimensions such as environmental , social , economic , ethical anddevelopment issues are becoming relevant."
FR2014012809,"Today , the term â € ˜agroecologyâ € ™ means either a scientific discipline , agricultural practice , or politicalor social movement."
FR2014012809,Here we study the different meanings of agroecology.
FR2014012809,"For that we analyse the historical development of agroecology.We present examples from USA , Brazil , Germany , and France."
FR2014012809,We study and discuss the evolution of different meanings agroecology.
FR2014012809,Theuse of the term agroecology can be traced back to the 1930s.
FR2014012809,"Until the 1960s agroecology referred only as a purely scientific discipline.Then , different branches of agroecology developed."
FR2014012809,"Following environmental movements in the 1960s that went against industrial agriculture , agroecology evolved and fostered agroecological movements in the 1990s."
FR2014012809,"Agroecology as an agricultural practice emerged in the 1980s , andwas often intertwined with movements."
FR2014012809,"Further , the scales and dimensions of agroecological investigations changed over the past 80 years fromthe plot and field scales to the farm and agroecosystem scales."
FR2014012809,"Actually three approaches persist : ( 1 ) investigations at plot and field scales , ( 2 ) investigations at the agroecosystem and farm scales , and ( 3 ) investigations covering the whole food system."
FR2014012809,These different approaches ofagroecological science can be explained by the history of nations.
FR2014012809,"In France , agroecology was mainly understood as a farming practice and tocertain extent as a movement , whereas the corresponding scientific discipline was agronomy."
FR2014012809,"In Germany , agroecology has a long tradition asa scientific discipline."
FR2014012809,"In the USA and in Brazil all three interpretations of agroecology occur , albeit with a predominance of agroecology as ascience in the USA and a stronger emphasis on movement and agricultural practice in Brazil."
FR2014012809,"These varied meanings of the term agroecologycause confusion among scientists and the public , and we recommend that those who publish using this term be explicit in their interpretation."
AJ2018003160,The effect of poultry manure application on maize ( Zea mays ) growth and yields was studied on a Ferric Acrisol in the semi-deciduous rain forest zone of Ghana.
AJ2018003160,"Eight treatments of 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 tons of poultry manure ( pm ) per hectare , 60-40-40 kg NPK / ha , 2 Ã — 2 t pm / ha and 2 t pm + 30-20-20 kg NPK / ha were used in a randomized complete block design ( RCBD ) with five replications."
AJ2018003160,The study showed that poultry manure is a valuable fertilizer and can serve as a suitable alternative to chemical fertilizer in the forest zone of Ghana.
AJ2018003160,"Poultry manure treatments produced higher values for height , leaf area index and biomass."
AJ2018003160,"The 4 t pm / ha rate produced maize grain yield of 2.07 t / ha which was statistically not different from that of the chemical fertilizer rate ( 2.29 t / ha ) and 6 t pm / ha ( 2.60 t / ha ) , while the 6 t pm / ha was not statistically different from the 8 t pm / ha rate."
AJ2018003160,Split application of 4 t pm / ha ( i.e. 2 Ã — 2 t pm / ha ) and 2 t pm / ha + 30-20-20 kg NPK / ha gave similar biomass and grain yields as the 4 t pm / ha.
AJ2018003160,"Poultry manure application registered over 53 % increases of N levels in the soil , from 0.09 % to 0.14 %."
AJ2018003160,Exchangeable cations increased with manure application.
AJ2018003160,The study recommends an application rate of 4 t pm / ha for maize on this type of soil in this agro-ecology.
IR2016700100,"In order to investigate the effects of drought caused by PEG 6000 and salinity induced by NaCl on germination and seedling growth of Clary , two experiments were carried out based on a completely randomized design with 4 replications."
IR2016700100,"In the first experiment , the effects of drought levels ( 0 , -2 , -4 , -6 , -8 , -10 , -12 bar ) and in the second one the effects of salinity levels ( 0 , 50 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 , 300 , 350 mmol ) on germination percentage , germination rate , seedling length and seedling dry weight was studied."
IR2016700100,Effect of salinity and drought stresses were significantly different between various treatments.
IR2016700100,The maximum rates and percentage of germination were obtained at control and the minimum percentage of germination was obtained at -12 bars and 350 mmol.
IR2016700100,Water potential significantly reduced seedling length and seedling dry weight.
IR2016700100,"Results showed that Clary , a medicinal plant , is highly tolerant to drought and salinity stresses during germination period."
CN2010001291,[ Objective ] To discuss regional response of reference evapotranspiration ( ET0 ) to global climate change and its influencing factors.
CN2010001291,[ Method ] Penman - Monteith equation was adopted to calculate ET0 in Australia from 1998 to 2007.
CN2010001291,Spatiotemporal change characteristics were analyzed by using GIS spatial analysis tools and relationships between ET0 and main climate factors were also analyzed.
CN2010001291,"[ Results ] The results showed that multi-year average ET0 increased from the east and south part to the northwest part and inland , and its distribution was consistent with climate zones."
CN2010001291,"Multi-year average ET0 of the whole region was 1750 mm , obtaining minimum and maximum values in 2000 and 2002 respectively."
CN2010001291,"Regional ET0 decreased in the order of summer , spring , autumn and winter ; January and December got the highest monthly ET0 , while June got the lowest value 79.55 mm."
CN2010001291,"ET0 positively correlated with mean temperature and solar radiation , R2 for each were 0.83 and 0.94 , while the relationship between ET0 and average relative humidity was negative , and precipitation had no significant relationship with ET0."
CN2010001291,[ Conclusion ] This research could provide important reference for crop water requirement study and making irrigation method for Australia.

SK2010100099,"Apart from the contents of Cr , when the concentration was in 85 % of the samples of grasses higher than permitted by the norm , the contents of the other heavy metals were not higher than maximum permissible quantity for forage crops."
SK2010100099,Correlation relations between the contents of heavy metals in grasses and in the soils were not statistically significant.
SK2010100099,The soil reaction correlated with the changes of Cu content in the grasses.
SK2010100099,The content of Cu decreased with the increased soil reaction.
SK2010100099,The locality was a dominant reason of variability of measured data of heavy metals in relation to a plant.
SK2010100099,"The achieved results demonstrate the possibility of utilization of the mixture of grasses as a bioindicator for the measurement of environmental contamination only in the case of chromium ; however , the grass species mixtures did not show their suitability for biomonitoring of other heavy metals."
JP2010001479,The important contribution to agricultural science by A.D. Thaer and J.H.v. Thuenen is not a question that needs to be argued.

DJ2012060765,"A study was undertaken to understand the practices and major constraints in bambara groundnut production , marketing and consumption in the Brong Ahafo ( Transition ) and Upper East ( Guinea Savannah ) Regions of Ghana."
DJ2012060765,"A total of 200 bambara producers , 33 marketers and 68 consumers were randomly chosen and interviewed from the Brong Ahafo and the Upper East Regions of Ghana."
DJ2012060765,"Three bambara groundnut growing districts in the Transition agro-ecology ; Nkoranza , Wenchi East and Wenchi West and four districts in the Guinea Savannah agro-ecology ; Bawku West , Kasena Nankana , Talensi Nabdam and Builsa were studied between August 2006 and January , 2007."
DJ2012060765,"Three separate questionnaires were developed to target producers , marketers and consumers in this study."
DJ2012060765,The study confirmed more females ( 63 % ) produced bambara than males ( 37 % ).
DJ2012060765,More farmers produced bambara solely for cash in the Transition ( 73 % ) whereas in the Guinea Savannah most farmers produced for cash and subsistence ( 78 % ).
DJ2012060765,Most farmers ( 65 % ) depend on farmer saved seeds for planting.
DJ2012060765,Sellers and consumers preferred white or cream seeds with large sizes.

AV2012045148,"Comparisons of production , water and energy efficiencies of aquaculture versus an array of fisheries and terrestrial agriculture systems show that non-fed aquaculture ( e.g. shellfish , seaweeds ) is among the worldâ € ™ s most efficient mass producer of plant and animal proteins."
AV2012045148,"Various fed aquaculture systems also match the most efficient forms of terrestrial animal husbandry , and trends suggest that carnivores in the wild have been transformed in aquaculture to omnivores , with impacts on resource use comparable to conventional , terrestrial agriculture systems , but are more efficient."
AV2012045148,"Production efficiencies of edible mass for a variety of aquaculture systems are 2.5 â € “ 4.5 kg dry feed / kg edible mass , compared with 3.0 â € “ 17.4 for a range of conventional terrestrial animal production systems."
AV2012045148,"Beef cattle require over 10 kg of feed to add 1 kg of edible weight , whereas tilapia and catfish use less than 3 kg to add a kg of edible weight."
AV2012045148,"Energy use in unfed and low - trophic - level aquaculture systems ( e.g. seaweeds , mussels , carps , tilapias ) is comparable to energy use in vegetable , sheep and rangeland beef agriculture."
AV2012045148,"Highest energy use is in fish cage and shrimp aquaculture , comparable to intensive animal agriculture feedlots , and extreme energy use has been reported for some of these aquaculture systems in Thailand."
AV2012045148,Capture fisheries are energy intensive in comparison with pond aquaculture of low - trophic - level species.
AV2012045148,"For example , to produce 1 kg of catfish protein about 34 kcal of fossil fuel energy is required ; lobster and shrimp capture fisheries use more than five times this amount of energy."
AV2012045148,"Energy use in intensive salmon cage aquaculture is less than in lobster and shrimp fishing , but is comparable to use in intensive beef production in feedlots."
AV2012045148,"Life Cycle Assessment of alternative grow - out technologies for salmon aquaculture in Canada has shown that for salmon cage aquaculture , feeds comprised 87 percent of total energy use , and fuel / electricity , 13 percent."
AV2012045148,Energy use in land - based recirculating systems was completely opposite : 10 percent of the total energy use was in feed and 90 percent in fossil fuel / electricity.
AV2012045148,Freshwater use remains a critical issue in aquaculture.
AV2012045148,Freshwater reuse systems have low consumptive use comparable to vegetable crops.
AV2012045148,Freshwater pond aquaculture systems have consumptive water use comparable to pig / chicken farming and the terrestrial farming of oil seed crops.
AV2012045148,"Extreme water use has been documented in shrimp , trout , and striped catfish operations."
AV2012045148,"Water use in striped catfish is of concern to Mekong policy - makers , as it is projected that these catfish aquaculture systems will expand and even surpass their present growth rate to reach an industry of approximately 1.5 million tonnes by 2020."
AV2012045148,"Water , energy and land usage in aquaculture are all interactive."
AV2012045148,"Reuse and cage aquaculture systems use less land and freshwater but have higher energy and feed requirements , with the exception of â € œno feedâ € cage and seawater ( e.g. shellfish , seaweeds ) systems."
AV2012045148,"Currently , reuse and cage aquaculture systems perform poorly in overall life cycle or other sustainability assessments in comparison to pond systems."
AV2012045148,Use of alternative renewable energy systems and the mobilization of alternative ( non-marine ) feed sources could improve the sustainability of reuse and cage systems considerably in the next decade.
AV2012045148,Resource use constraints on the expansion of global aquaculture are different for fed and non-fed aquaculture.
AV2012045148,"Over the past decade for non-fed shellfish aquaculture , there has been a remarkable global convergence around the notion that solutions to user ( space ) conflicts can be solved not only through technological advances , but also by a growing global consensus that shellfish aquaculture can â € œfit inâ € , not only environmentally but also in a socially responsible manner , to many coastal environments worldwide , the vast majority of which are already overcrowded with existing uses."
AV2012045148,"For fed aquaculture , new indicators of resource use have been developed and promulgated."
AV2012045148,Before this resource use in fed aquaculture was being measured in terms of feed conversion ratios ( FCRs ) followed by FIFO ( â € œfish in fish outâ € ) ratios.
AV2012045148,First publications a decade ago measured values of FIFO in marine fish and shrimp aquaculture.
AV2012045148,"More comprehensive indicator assessments of fish feed equivalencies , protein efficiency ratios and fish feed equivalences will allow more informed decision - making on resource use and efficiencies."
AV2012045148,"Over the past decade , aquafeed companies have accelerated research to reduce the use of marine proteins and oils in feed formulations , and have adopted indicators for the production efficiencies in terms of â € œmarine protein and oil dependency ratiosâ € for fed aquaculture species."
AV2012045148,"Current projections are that over the next decade , fed aquaculture will use less marine fishmeals / oils while overall aquaculture production will continue its rapid growth."
AV2012045148,"Over the past decade , new , environmentally sound technologies and resource - efficient farming systems have been developed , and new examples of the integration of aquaculture into coastal area and inland watershed management plans have been achieved ; however , most are still at the pilot scale commercially or are part of regional governance systems , and are not widespread."
AV2012045148,"These pilot - scale models of commercial aquaculture ecosystems are highly productive , water and land efficient , and are net energy and protein producers which follow design principles similar to those used in the fields of agroecology and agro-ecosystems."
AV2012045148,"Good examples exist for both temperate zone and tropical nations with severe land , water and energy constraints."
AV2012045148,"Increasing technological efficiencies in the use of land , water , food , seed and energy through sustainable intensification such as the widespread adoption of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture ( IMTA ) and integrated agriculture - aquaculture farming ecosystems approaches will not be enough , since these will improve only the efficiency of resource use and increase yields per unit of inputs and do not address social constraints and user conflicts."
AV2012045148,"In most developing countries , an exponentially growing population to 2050 will require aquaculture to expand rapidly into land and water areas that are currently held in common."
AV2012045148,"Aquaculture expansion into open - water freshwater and marine waters raises the complex issues of access to and management of common pool resources , and conflicts with exiting users that could cause acute social , political and economic problems."
AV2012045148,"The seminal works of 2009 Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom could provide important insights for the orderly expansion of aquaculture into a more crowded , resource - efficient world striving to be sustainable , and rife with user conflicts."
QT2016105187,Ethiopia is a leading honey producer in Africa and one of the ten largest honey producing countries in the world.
QT2016105187,"Despite the favorable agro-ecology for honey production and the number of bee colonies the country is endowed with , the level of honey production and productivity in the country is still low."
QT2016105187,The annual average honey production per hive is as low as 6 - 7 kg.
QT2016105187,One of the prominent factors for this low honey productivity is traditional hive and lack of improved beekeeping management techniques.
QT2016105187,"With the aim of enhancing the level of honey production both in quantity and quality , the Improving Productivity and Market Success ( IPMS ) project introduced a participatory market oriented value chain development approach in Fogera and with a group of stakeholders worked on improving production , input supply and marketing."
QT2016105187,"The project partners trained beekeepers on colony splitting , hive making and seasonal bee colony management practices."
QT2016105187,"In addition , the project facilitated the establishment of beekeeping input supply shop and advised beehive producers ( carpenters ) on the proper design of top - bar and frame - type hives."
QT2016105187,The adoption rate of the improved beekeeping has been improved substantially after the skill development trainings and production of appropriate beehives in the district.
QT2016105187,"The number of improved beehives adopted in the district increased from 200 in 2006 to 882 in 2009 , following the 2007 and 2009 beekeeping training through technical and financial support of IPMS project."
QT2016105187,"Through the beekeeping technology transformation , the average annual honey productivity per hive has also increased from 7 to 13 kg by changing the hives from traditional to top - bar hives and frame hives."
QT2016105187,"In addition to what has been achieved in enhancing the level of honey production , the technology transformation also improved honey quality substantially."
QT2016105187,"At present , productivity is at a level which leaves room for improvement."
QT2016105187,Challenges ahead will concern marketing of honey production as prices do not yet reflect the use of improved beehives.
QT2016105187,"Accordingly , better linkages to appropriate markets , introduction to different markets for liquid honey , establish honeybee products marketing cooperatives still have to be investigated and / or developed."
QT2016105187,From this intervention we have learned that the introduction of improved beekeeping technology and associated practices coupled with strengthening the involvement of other stakeholders along the value chain will enhance productivities of beekeeping business.

DJ2012054394,"The competitive behaviour of sorghum - cowpea intercrops at different planting patterns were studied at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching and Research farm , Bauchi in the northern Guinea savanna of Nigeria during the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons."
DJ2012054394,"The treatments comprised of three row arrangements of sorghum / cowpea mixtures ; one row of sorghum for one row of cowpea ( 1S : 1C ) , two rows of sorghum for one row of cowpea ( 2S : 1C ) and one row of sorghum for two rows of cowpea ( 1S : 2C ) , respectively."
DJ2012054394,Sole crops of sorghum and cowpea were included as check to compare yields of intercropped mixtures.
DJ2012054394,Results indicated that grain and straw yields of both sorghum and cowpea were higher in sole cropping than in the intercropping mixtures.
DJ2012054394,"However , the 2S : 1C planting arrangement exhibited higher LER , competitive indices values , SPI and MAI ( N7857 .11 ) compared to the other planting arrangements and the sole crops."
DJ2012054394,"From this study , it is inferred that intercropping of sorghum with cowpea at 2S : 1C planting pattern will give higher income , better land use efficiency and thus enhancing sustainability of crop production than sole culture of each crop species."
QT2016102715,Development issues in developing countries belong to complex situations where society and environment are intricate.
QT2016102715,"However , such sites lack the necessary amount of reliable , checkable data and information , while these very constraining factors determine the populations ' evolutions , such as villagers living in Sahelian environments."
QT2016102715,"Beyond a game - theory model that leads to a premature selection of the relevant variables , we build an individual - centered , empirical , KIDS - oriented ( Keep It Descriptive & Simple ) , and multidisciplinary agent - based model focusing on the villagers \ ' differential accesses to economic and production activities according to social rules and norms , mainly driven by social criteria from which gender and rank within the family are the most important , as they were observed and registered during individual interviews."
QT2016102715,The purpose of the work is to build a valid and robust model that overcome this lack of data by building a individual specific system of behaviour rules conditioning these differential accesses showing the long - term catalytic effects of small changes of social rules.
QT2016102715,"The model - building methodology is thereby crucial : the interviewing process provided the behaviour rules and criteria while the context , i.e. the economic , demographic and agro-ecological environment is described following published or unpublished literature."
QT2016102715,"Thanks to a sensitivity analysis on several selected parameters , the model appears fairly robust and sensitive enough."
QT2016102715,The confidence building simulation outputs reasonably reproduces the dynamics of local situations and is consistent with three authors having investigated in our site.
QT2016102715,"Thanks to its empirical approach and its balanced conception between sociology and agro-ecology at the relevant scale , i.e. the individual tied to social relations , limitations and obligations and connected with his / her biophysical and economic environment , the model can be considered as an efficient "" trend provider "" but not an absolute "" figure provider "" for simulating rural societies of the Nigrien Sahel and testing scenarios on the same context."

CZ2010000774,A 2 - year field experiment was conducted under light enrichment and shading conditions to examine the responses of seed yield and yield components distribution across main axis in soybean.
CZ2010000774,"The results showed that the maximum increase in seed yield per plant by light enrichment occurred at 27 plants / square m , while the most significant reduction in seed yield per plant by shading occurred at 54 plants / square m. Light enrichment beginning at early flowering stage decreased seed size on average by 7 % while shading increased seed size on average by 9 % over densities and cultivars , resulting in a fewer extent compensation in seed yield decrement."
CZ2010000774,Responses to light enrichment and shading occurred proportionately across the main axis node positions despite the differences in the time ( 15 - 20 days ) of development of yield components between the high and low node positions.
CZ2010000774,Variation intensity of seed size of the three cultivars was dissimilar as a result of changes in the environment during the reproductive period.
CZ2010000774,"The small - seed cultivar had the greatest stability in single seed size across the main axis , followed by moderate - seed cultivar , while large - seed cultivar was the least stable."
CZ2010000774,"Although maximum seed size may be determined by genetic potential in soybean plants , our results suggested that seed size can still be modified by environmental conditions , and the impact can be expressed through some internal control moderating the final size of most seeds in main stem and in all pods."
CZ2010000774,"It indicates that , through redistributing the available resources across main stem to components , soybean plants showed the mechanism , in an attempt to maintain or improve yield in a constantly changing environment."
CZ2010000777,"Soil water content under no fertilizer ( NF ) , fertilizer ( F ) ( N : 30 ; P2O5 : 45 kg / ha ) , and fertilizer plus pig manure ( FO ) ( N : 30 ; P2O5 : 45 kg / ha ; pig manure 15 000 kg / ha in 2003 ; and 30 000 kg / ha in 2004 and 2005 ) treatments was measured using neutron probe instrument for a period of three years in a long term field experiment in order to investigate the impact of different fertilization treatments on Haploborolls soil water content."
CZ2010000777,Fertilization had significant effects on the soil water content.
CZ2010000777,"FO treatment had greater soil water content in 10 cm depth than F treatment with average 9.9 % increase ( P less than 0.05 ) but lower than NF treatment ; however , in the depth from 30 to 90 cm , there was no water content difference between F and FO treatments."
CZ2010000777,Treatment with organic amendments reduced total soil water content on the long term experiment basis.
CZ2010000777,"Across the three years , no fertilizer treatment had total soil water content higher by 1.2 % and 3.1 % than fertilizer treatment and fertilizer plus pig manure treatment within 10 to 210 cm soil profile in most of the months , respectively."
CN2011000363,"The study was done in order to explore the effect of natural sunlight hours on soybean yield and chemical quality in the pod stage , and to provide reference for cultural practices of high yield and superior quality soybean with high oil or protein content."
CN2011000363,"The effect of different sunlight hours controlled by human on soybean yield , oil and protein content was conducted in the field with random blocks design."
CN2011000363,The results showed that the effects of different sunlight hours on soybean yield and chemical quality with high oil or protein content ( Dongnong 434 and Dongnong 42 ) were different.
CN2011000363,"Soybean yield of the two cultivars declined evidently with shortened sunlight hours in the pod stage , and declined level of Dongnong 42 was higher than that of Dongnong 434."
CN2011000363,"Oil and protein content of the two cultivars were not changed distinctly , and gross contents of oil and protein of Dongnong 434 and Dongnong 42 were improved by proper shortened sunlight hours in the pod stage."
CN2011000363,"These indicated that the effect of natural sunlight hours in the pod stage on soybean yield was visible , but that of chemical quality wasnâ € ™ t obvious."

US2016206840,"Intend to debate where the agroecological families are located in this territory if has or not a territory of agroecology , how they can survive using this type of agriculture and to show the importance of the commercialization ( especially in the trade fair ) of this production as a source of economic resources for this families."
BY2011000254,Intensive technologies are developed for wild hooved animals cultivation in Slutsk region ( Belarus ) and recultivation of deserted agrocoenosis at peat soils is made for the purpose of additional feeding of game animals.
BY2011000254,These measures allow to recover wild hooved animals populations and attract red deer.
BY2011000254,Animals are fed at 5000 forest hectares.
BY2011000254,New high technologies permitted to achieve the greatest possible outcome ( number of species at 1000 forest hectares ) and total density of hooved animals population many timesexceeds average indexes for Belarus.
BY2011000254,Pasture burden fo hooved animals has considerably decreased for agricultural lands.
BY2011000495,In the conditions of the Republic of Belarus there was analyzed the potential of soil and land resources.
BY2011000495,For the realization of the evaluation there first there were chosen soil and ecological regions with domination of erosion and water - logged landscapes which can be well seen on the 1:200000 soil maps.
BY2011000495,"However , the main objects of the research and the operational units for the evaluation of soil and land resource potential were soil combination as natural systems and soil types."

SK2010000296,"Soil compaction in agricultural areas inhibits plant root growth through increased mechanical resistance , altered water and nutrient supply."
SK2010000296,The main objective of this study was to evaluate spatial distribution of roots and its effect on water uptake of maize grown on field with subsoil compaction.
SK2010000296,Two treatments were examined : complex melioration consisting of deep loosening in combination with drainage and control without applied meliorations.
SK2010000296,Root observations were conducted on vertical and superposed horizontal planes covered with a 2 cm grid short after silking.
SK2010000296,Root distributions expressed as index of density and / or dry mass density were estimated down to 1 m soil depth and with a distance to a plant base.
SK2010000296,"For analysis of root distribution pattern on the horizontal planes , a Variance to Mean Ratio ( VMR ) test was applied."
SK2010000296,Soil water monitoring were conducted during the vegetation period.
SK2010000296,"On the vertical planes , root densities were similar in the topsoil of both treatments , but the results were significantly higher in the subsoil of the meliorated one showing deeper allocation of root density."
SK2010000296,"In contrast , the control had more squares with lots of roots ( i.e. higher indexes ) just at the top - subsoil boundary owing to bunching of roots in macropores."
SK2010000296,"The horizontal planes in the control generally consisted larger areas without visible roots and thus great distances for water and nutrient transmission , especially in the subsoil."
SK2010000296,The estimated VMR also pointed toward different levels of root clustering.
SK2010000296,"Consequently , an inhibited water extraction from the subsoil in the control , a delay in crop ontogenesis and a less biomass production was established during the observed period."
PK2011000623,"An experiment was conducted at Cereal Crops Research Institute ( CCRI ) , Pirsabak , Nowshera ( NWFP ) Pakistan during 2007 - 08 on six wheat genotypes ( PR - 88 , PR - 90 , PR - 94 , PR - 95 , PR - 96 and Saleem - 2000 ) to identify the most suitable time of planting and judge their performance under different planting dates in the central agro-ecological zone of NWFP , Pakistan."

CZ2010000876,We tried to determine the mechanisms by which Ca2 + mediated NO - induced programmed cell death ( PCD ) in tobacco protoplasts.
CZ2010000876,Treatment of tobacco protoplasts with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside ( SNP ) resulted in a rapid [ Ca2 + ] cyt accumulation and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential before the appearance of PCD.
CZ2010000876,"NO - induced PCD could be largely prevented not only by NO scavenger c - PTIO , but also by EGTA ( Ca2 + chelator ) , LaCl3 ( Ca2 + - channel blocker ) or CsA ( a specific mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor , which also inhibit Ca2 + cycling by mitochondria )."
CZ2010000876,All results suggested that NO - induced PCD is mediated through mitochondrial pathway and regulated by Ca2 +.

PH2011000734,Dormancy in lily ( Lilium sp. ) bulbs is broken by a cold period of several weeks.
PH2011000734,"Sprouting percentage , growth and flower quality are reduced when bulbs are partially released from dormancy."
PH2011000734,"To understand the involvement of phytohormones in dormancy release in lily bulbs , the concentration of endogenous abscisic acid ( ABA ) , gibberellic acid ( GA3 ) , zeatin ( ZT ) and 3 - indoleacetic acid ( IAA ) was examined in the primary shoot , outer scale and root of bulbs of Oriental hybrid Lilium ' Siberia ' during the dormancy release period."
PH2011000734,"Cold treatment ( 4 deg C ) enhanced ABA , GA3 and ZT concentration in the primary shoot."
PH2011000734,"GA3 , ZT and ABA reached their maximum levels on the 14th , 49th and 63rd days of cold storage , respectively."
PH2011000734,"IAA concentration remained at a constant level in the primary shoot of bulbs at 4 deg C up to 21 d. Thereafter , it increased gradually up to the maximum level on the 84th day."
PH2011000734,"In the outer scale of the bulbs , GA3 increased dramatically on the 7th day , then declined till the end of the 4 deg C treatment."
PH2011000734,"In the root , GA3 was a higher level in the bulbs at 4 deg C than at 25 deg C treatment before 42 d."
PH2011000734,The ratios of phytohormone that promote plant growth to phytohormone that inhibit plant growth were higher in the outer scale of the bulbs at 4 deg C than those at 25 deg C treatment before 42 d.
PH2011000734,The ratios were lower in the primary shoot of the bulbs after 42 d of the 4 deg C treatment than those at 25 deg C.
PH2011000734,"In conclusion , cold treatment enhanced AB A , GA3 and ZT concentration and effectively regulated IAA concentration to reach the maximum level at the end of dormancy release period in the primary shoot of bulbs under 4 deg C treatment."
PH2011000734,"Apparently , changes in ABA and GA3 concentration differ in the primary shoot , outer scale and root of the bulbs of lily."
PH2011000734,These changes act as multipurpose signals in the control of bulb dormancy release in the different tissues of the bulb and during the different stages of bulb development.
PH2011000734,"Apparently , there is a relationship between ABA and IAA concentration and bulb sprouting."

FR2014016982,The stability of soil organic matter ( SOM ) is a major source of uncertainty in predicting atmospheric CO2 concentration during the 21st century.
FR2014016982,"Isolating the stable soil carbon ( C ) from other , more labile , C fractions in soil is of prime importance for calibrating soil C simulation models , and gaining insights into the mechanisms that lead to soil C stability."
FR2014016982,"Long - term experiments with continuous bare fallow ( vegetation - free ) treatments in which the decay of soil C is monitored for decades after all inputs of C have stopped , provide a unique opportunity to assess the quantity of stable soil C."
FR2014016982,"We analyzed data from six bare fallow experiments of long - duration ( > 30 yrs ) , covering a range of soil types and climate conditions , and sited at Askov ( Denmark ) , Grignon and Versailles ( France ) , Kursk ( Russia ) , Rothamsted ( UK ) , and Ultuna ( Sweden )."
FR2014016982,"A conceptual three pool model dividing soil C into a labile pool ( turnover time of a several years ) , an intermediate pool ( turnover time of a several decades ) and a stable pool ( turnover time of a several centuries or more ) fits well with the long term C decline observed in the bare fallow soils."
FR2014016982,The estimate of stable C ranged from 2.7 g C kgâˆ ’ 1 at Rothamsted to 6.8 g C kgâˆ ’ 1 at Grignon.

CN2012002311,Soil microbial properties are important bio-indicators of soil health.
CN2012002311,"Therefore , soil microbial properties were studied under different soil organic matter levels in order to provide a theoretical basis for maintaining or improving soil ecological functions in Chinese mollisols farmland."
CN2012002311,"Method : The soils with different soil organic matters ( SOM ) contents were removed from Bei'an , Nenjiang and Hailun in Heilongjiang province , Dehui and Lishu in Jilin province to Hailun agroecology experimental station in Heilongjiang province , then soil microbial properties such as microbial biomass , activity , functional diversity of microbial community were investigated for five soils with different SOM contents by using Biolog and other universal analysis in the fifth year after soil spatial removal in Hailun agroecology experimental station."
CN2012002311,"Result : The results showed that soil microbial biomass C , soil basic respiration , and the amount of soil bacteria and fungi were increased with SOM increasing."
CN2012002311,Soil microbial properties in Bei'an with the highest content of SOM reached significant differences with the other soils.
CN2012002311,The average well color development values ( AWCD ) also indicated that the metabolizing capacity of microbe population in Bei'an was higher than that in Lishu with the lowest content of SOM.
CN2012002311,It was different for the carbon source used by microbe population under different SOM levels.
CN2012002311,"The sensitive microbe C sources were Î ± - butanone acid , putrescine , D , and L - Î ± - glycerol which effectively used by soil microbe population in Bei'an and Nenjiang with higher SOM content."

CN2012002311,Conclusion : These results showed that different SOM contents of black soils affected the metabolic functions of microbial community under the same external environmental conditions in farmland.
CZ2011000341,Low availability of phosphorus in soil is a major constraint for crop production in agricultural ecosystems.
CZ2011000341,"Therefore , it is very important to explain the adaptive mechanism of crops under low P conditions."
CZ2011000341,The response of high - and low - P efficient soybean genotypes to various external P level was carried out in nutrient solution culture.
CZ2011000341,"Results showed that Dongnong1031 ( low P - efficient genotype ) undergoes major changes in terms of dry mass , root length , root number and root surface , whereas the response of Hai 616 ( high P - efficient genotype ) was less pronounced after five weeks of growth."
CZ2011000341,"The higher P level in solution , the smaller difference between the two genotypes in these characteristics."
CZ2011000341,"The amount of H + released by root of Dongnong1031 was lower than that of Hai 616 , except when supplied with 50 micromol external P."
CZ2011000341,"There was a positive relationship between relative P absorption efficiency ( RPAE ) and P concentration in shoot and root material at all P levels , irrespective of soybean genotype."
CZ2011000341,An exponential relationship was found between P utilization efficiency ( PUE ) and P concentrations in shoots and roots.
CZ2011000341,These results suggested that an increase in measured root characteristics coupled with H + release by roots were key mechanisms for soybean genotypes with high - P efficiency to cope with low P conditions when grown in solution.
CZ2011000341,In order to best select high soybean genotype with high - P efficiency one should pay attention to PUE combined with high RPAE.

AU2019106342,Phosphorus ( P ) - deficiency is a significant challenge for agricultural productivity on many highly P - sorbing weathered and tropical soils throughout the world.
AU2019106342,On these soils it can be necessary to apply up to five-fold more P as fertiliser than is exported in products.
AU2019106342,"Given the finite nature of global P resources , it is important that such inefficiencies be addressed."
AU2019106342,"For low P - sorbing soils , P - efficient farming systems will also assist attempts to reduce pollution associated with P losses to the environment."
AU2019106342,"P - balance inefficiency of farms is associated with loss of P in erosion , runoff or leaching , uneven dispersal of animal excreta , and accumulation of P as sparingly - available phosphate and organic P in the soil."
AU2019106342,In many cases it is possible to minimise P losses in runoff or erosion.
AU2019106342,Uneven dispersal of P in excreta typically amounts to ~ 5 % of P - fertiliser inputs.
AU2019106342,"However , the rate of P accumulation inmoderate to highly P - sorbing soils is a major contributor to inefficient P - fertiliser use."
AU2019106342,"We discuss the causal edaphic , plant and microbial factors in the context of soil P management , P cycling and productivity goals of farms."
AU2019106342,"Management interventions that can alter P - use efficiency are explored , including better targeted P - fertiliser use , organic amendments , removing other constraints to yield , zone management , use of plants with low critical - P requirements , and modified farming systems."
AU2019106342,"Higher productivity in low - P soils , or lower P inputs in fertilised agricultural systems can be achieved by various interventions , but it is also critically important to understand the agroecology of plant P nutrition within farming systems for improvements in P - use efficiency to be realised."

IR2016700071,Results showed that Artichoke was more resistant than Purple coneflower to osmotic and salinity stresses.
IR2016700071,"Germination percentages of Artichoke and Purple coneflower were 72 and 5 % in -10 bar osmotic stress , respectively ; while germination percentages of Artichoke and Purple coneflower were 75 and 8 % in -5 bar salinity stress , respectively."
IR2016700071,"Increasing osmotic stress severity increased mean germination time of Artichoke , while the effect of different osmotic stress levels was not significant on mean germination time of Purple coneflower."
IR2016700071,"Radicle / plumule length ratio was increased by increasing osmotic and salinity levels in Artichoke , while this ratio was not varied by osmotic stress and was decreased by salinity stress in Purple Coneflower."
IR2016700071,"Moreover , seedling dry weight was decreased by increasing osmotic and salinity stress in both medicinal plants."
IR2016700071,"Overall , it seems that germination indices and seedling growth in Artichoke were superior to Purple coneflower under stress conditions."
DJ2012062675,Increased food production in Nigeria has over the years been attributed to area expansion while reports of shortened fallow period of farmlands are suggestive of shift towards intensification.
DJ2012062675,The study examines the structure of land - use intensification in food crop production in Southwestern Nigeria towards determining its drivers and concordance with condition for sustainable intensification.
DJ2012062675,The results showed that land - use intensification is characterized by high frequency of cultivation ( 79 % ) and high cropping intensity estimated as 1.24 years / ha.
DJ2012062675,Cropping intensity was however higher in the derived and southern guinea savannah than forest agroecology.
DJ2012062675,"However , about 48 % , 32 % and 12 % made use of inorganic fertilizer , tractor and herbicide respectively."
DJ2012062675,Farm and farmer specific attributes significantly influenced level of land - use intensity of food crop farmers.
DJ2012062675,The structure of land - use intensity portrays challenges for sustainable growth through intensification thus underscoring the need for adequate focus on sustainable land management messages by the extension system.

GB2012100191,Growing attention to climate change around the world has led to a wide array of policy measures to mitigate its effects.
GB2012100191,"In the tropics , this has led to the proposal of mechanisms to change land use patterns in order to reduce carbon emissions , or promote carbon capture and storage."
GB2012100191,"The rural communities that depend on these resources have increasingly been included in discussions around these mechanisms , in the hopes that rural development could be promoted simultaneously with climate change mitigation."
GB2012100191,"Success in achieving these dual goals has been elusive however , driving continued debates around which territories , actors and mechanisms are best suited to support these efforts."

FR2014015431,"The recent shifts in P. striiformis virulence patterns and aggressiveness , which have had a large impact on rust resistance in a number of commercial wheat and triticale varieties in Europe , have stressed the need for timely pathogen survey activities and rapid dissemination of results."
FR2014015431,"Dynamic P. striiformis virulence data are now publicly available via the EuroWheat website www.eurowheat.org , which also informs about options for disease control , such as agricultural practices and fungicide efficacies ( JÃ ¸ rgensen et al. 2010 )."
FR2014015431,"The emergence of new yellow rust races in the European P. striiformis population has until recently been ascribed to frequent mutations resulting in a shift from avirulence to virulence at the phenotypic level ( HovmÃ ¸ ller & Justesen , 2007 ) , followed by selection due to host resistance genes , clonal reproduction and widespread dispersal of urediniospores carried by the wind at scales from the individual field to continent ( Enjalbert et al. 2005 ; HovmÃ ¸ ller et al. 2002 )."

RS2011001374,Chickens fed oregano oil supplemented diet ( 0.707 g / kg ) had significantly higher body weight gain ( BWG ) in the grower ( 19 - 29 d ) and finisher ( 30 - 42 d ) periods.
RS2011001374,Total plasma immunoglobulin levels were lower while mineral levels were higher during the finisher period.

RS2011001374,Proliferative activity of enterocytes significantly increased in the finisher period along duodenal villi in animals treated with essential oil extracted from oregano.
RS2011001374,We suppose that higher body performance was probably the result of higher digestibility in the digestive tract.

FR2016218680,One of the main aims of sustainable agriculture is to reduce the risk of disease in cropping systems and thereby contribute to preserving public health and conserving the environment.
FR2016218680,"In particular , if we are to reduce our recourse to agrochemicals , we need to acquire a deeper understanding of ecological processes , for instance biological pest control by predatory arthropods such as Carabids."
FR2016218680,"We analyzed the population dynamics of a carabid ( Pterostichus melanarius ) in various cropping systems ( conventional , integrated , and organic ) to improve our limited knowledge of its potential impact on insect populations."
FR2016218680,"To do this , we built a model composed of three coupled modules , each referring to different assumptions : a phenology module of the carabid species was based on a periodic Leslie - matrix model and a 1:1 sex ratio , the population was spatialized in Brittany ( Western France ) using a spatially implicit landscape module that simulated the capacity of grass margins to provide shelter for this carabid beetle , and an agronomic module was used to assess the effects of different crop management systems on the beetle population."
FR2016218680,Our results showed that the spread of P. melanarius larvae by farming practices was key to species presence in crop fields.
FR2016218680,"This was greatly dependent upon the farming calendar , the intensity of farming practices , and the presence of shelter zones."
FR2016218680,Maintaining and managing uncultivated habitats such as grass margins is thus as crucial for this beneficial predator as managing cultivated fields ( asymptotic growth of the population was found to be 25 % higher in integrated and organic management systems when 20 % grass margins were present ).
FR2016218680,"At the field level , integrated management and direct drilling ( with minimum disruption of the soil surface ) are the best crop management systems for P. melanarius survival."
FR2016218680,"Organic management is less effective ( asymptotic growth of the population is only half that of integrated and direct - drilling management systems ) , for it requires multiple soil tilling to compensate for the absence of herbicides."
FR2016218680,"Winter oilseed rape is the most detrimental crop ( asymptotic growth of the population is half that seen with other crops ) , as it gives rise to summer molluscicides and soil tillage."
FR2016218680,This is the first study developing a numerical model of the long - term effects of landscape composition and cropping system on this beneficial predator species.
FR2016218680,This approach provides a powerful tool to test hypotheses and quantify their possible effects inagroecology

FR2014016027,"We compared the performance of eight widely used , easily accessible and well - documented crop growth simulation models ( APES , CROPSYST , DAISY , DSSAT , FASSET , HERMES , STICS and WOFOST ) for winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L. ) during 49 growing seasons at eight sites in northwestern , Central and southeastern Europe."
FR2014016027,"The aim was to examine how different process - based crop models perform at the field scale when provided with a limited set of information for model calibration and simulation , reflecting the typical use of models for large - scale applications , and to present the uncertainties related to this type of model application."
FR2014016027,"Data used in the simulations consisted of daily weather statistics , information on soil properties , information on crop phenology for each cultivar , and basic crop and soil management information."
FR2014016027,"Our results showed that none of the models perfectly reproduced recorded observations at all sites and in all years , and none could unequivocally be labelled robust and accurate in terms of yield prediction across different environments and crop cultivars with only minimum calibration."
FR2014016027,"The best performance regarding yield estimation was for DAISY and DSSAT , for which the RMSE values were lowest ( 1428 and 1603 kg haâˆ ’ 1 ) and the index of agreement ( 0.71 and 0.74 ) highest."
FR2014016027,"CROPSYST systematically underestimated yields ( MBE â € “ 1186 kg haâˆ ’ 1 ) , whereas HERMES , STICS and WOFOST clearly overestimated them ( MBE 1174 , 1272 and 1213 kg haâˆ ’ 1 , respectively )."
FR2014016027,"APES , DAISY , HERMES , STICS and WOFOST furnished high total above - ground biomass estimates , whereas CROPSYST , DSSAT and FASSET provided low total above - ground estimates."
FR2014016027,"Consequently , DSSAT and FASSET produced very high harvest index values , followed by HERMES and WOFOST."
FR2014016027,"APES and DAISY , on the other hand , returned low harvest index values."
FR2014016027,"In spite of phenological observations being provided , the calibration results for wheat phenology , i.e. estimated dates of anthesis and maturity , were surprisingly variable , with the largest RMSE for anthesis being generated by APES ( 20.2 days ) and for maturity by HERMES ( 12.6 )."
FR2014016027,The wide range of grain yield estimates provided by the models for all sites and years reflects substantial uncertainties in model estimates achieved with only minimum calibration.
FR2014016027,"Mean predictions from the eight models , on the other hand , were in good agreement with measured data."
FR2014016027,This applies to both results across all sites and seasons as well as to prediction of observed yield variability at single sites â € “ a very important finding that supports the use of multi-model estimates rather than reliance on single models.

FR2013101555,Cucurbits fruit flies ( Diptera : Tephritidae ) are major pests of vegetable crops in Reunion.
FR2013101555,"Up to now , the protection of the latter relied mainly on agrochemistry."
FR2013101555,The broad spectrum insecticides are however considered as uneffective by the growers themselves and are largely harmful for health and environment.
FR2013101555,"We thus conceived a project of research , development and education , in order to bring a sustainable management methodology of these pests."
FR2013101555,"This innovative project , called GAMOUR , is a premiere in Europe."
FR2013101555,"It gathers the numerous actors of agriculture in Reunion , firstly the growers who are the eventual recepients of this methodology."
FR2013101555,"GAMOUR relies on the axioms of agroecological crop management : sanitation , habitat management and conservative biological control."
FR2013101555,"Our action has started since early 2009 in three Â « conventionnal Â » pilot area totalizing about 50ha of cultures and 30 growers , as well as in four organic farms ( the technical package is compatible with organic farming specifications )."
FR2013101555,"We present now the first results yielded after two years of agroecological practices : ( i ) field assessement of method effectiveness , ( ii ) monitoring of fly populations in pilot areas ( iii ) monitoring of crop productions , ( iv ) satisfaction survey of implied growers."
FR2013101555,These results are highly encouraging : chemical sprayings have been stopped while vegetable yields are at least as high as before.
FR2013101555,"As a consequence , the growersÂ ¿ incomes are increasing."
FR2013101555,Our field experimentations confirm the efffectiveness of techniques firstly assessed in laboratory conditions.
FR2013101555,"In particular , the corn borders ( push - pull ) concentrate more than 95 % of fly populations which are thereafter suppressed by food baits."
FR2013101555,"Mass trapping , without insecticides , is efficient for two of the three vegetable fly species."
FR2013101555,The growers quickly appropriate these techniques.
FR2013101555,"For example , sanitation is regularly applied thanks to the locally designed "" augmentarium ""."
FR2013101555,This confirms that agroecology is a suitable alternative to agrochemistry for crop protection purpose.We now intend to extend this methodology to foreign countries in Indian Ocean.

FR2014005997,"Following the example of numerous regions in the world , the French West Indies Departments , in turn , can not avoid challenging their own model of agricultural production."
FR2014005997,"The transition , from an agroindustrial model to a model based on diversification and ecological intensification for a better satisfaction of the local food demand and the production of ecosystemic services , is henceforth inescapable."
FR2014005997,"Alternative solutions have been studied by the agronomic research for decades , just as original initiatives have been taken by producers in the prospect of innovative system design."
FR2014005997,"The aim of this article is to set up the basis for a better shared understanding of priorities , organizational patterns and necessary methods to co-design the innovative systems of the future in the Overseas."
FR2014005997,This approach is reinforced by a choice of local or regional examples intended to build a shared vision.
FR2014005997,It eventually proposes some options for the emergence of sustainable agricultural systems in the French West Indies and Guyana.
FR2014008137,"Agriculture is facing up to an increasing number of challenges , including the need to ensure various ecosystem services and to resolve apparent conflicts between them."
FR2014008137,One of the ways forward for agriculture currently being debated is a set of principles grouped together under the umbrella term â € œecological intensificationâ €.
FR2014008137,"In published studies , ecological intensification has generally been considered to be based essentially on the use of biological regulation to manage agroecosystems , at field , farm and landscape scales."
FR2014008137,We propose here five additional avenues that agronomic research could follow to strengthen the ecological intensification of current farming systems.
FR2014008137,We begin by assuming that progress in plant sciences over the last two decades provides new insight of potential use to agronomists.
FR2014008137,"Potentially useful new developments in plant science include advances in the fields of energy conversion by plants , nitrogen use efficiency and defence mechanisms against pests."
FR2014008137,"We then suggest that natural ecosystems may also provide sources of inspiration for cropping system design , in terms of their structure and function on the one hand , and farmersâ € ™ knowledge on the other."
FR2014008137,Natural ecosystems display a number of interesting properties that could be incorporated into agroecosystems.
FR2014008137,"We discuss the value and limitations of attempting to â € ˜mimicâ € ™ their structure and function , while considering the differences in objectives and constraints between these two types of system."
FR2014008137,Farmers develop extensive knowledge of the systems they manage.
FR2014008137,"We discuss ways in which this knowledge could be combined with , or fed into scientific knowledge and innovation , and the extent to which this is likely to be possible."
FR2014008137,The two remaining avenues concern methods.
FR2014008137,"We suggest that agronomists make more use of meta - analysis and comparative system studies , these two types of methods being commonly used in other disciplines but barely used in agronomy."
FR2014008137,Meta - analysis would make it possible to quantify variations of cropping system performances in interaction with soil and climate conditions more accurately across environments and socio - economic contexts.
FR2014008137,Comparative analysis would help to identify the structural characteristics of cropping and farming systems underlying properties of interest.
FR2014008137,Such analysis can be performed with sets of performance indicators and methods borrowed from ecology for analyses of the structure and organisation of these systems.
FR2014008137,These five approaches should make it possible to deepen our knowledge of agroecosystems foraction
FR2014010232,"For the last 20 years , sunflower world acreages have largely increased."
FR2014010232,"In 2010 , they reached 24 million hectares."
FR2014010232,"Two thirds are located in Europe ( 4 million hectares ) , in Russia and Ukraine ( 11.3 million hectares ) where the acreage can still expand a lot."
FR2014010232,"This situation is favourable for research , breeding , seeds production , exchangeâ € ¦ all the more that sunflower price seems well oriented and that its oil is globally well appreciated."
FR2014010232,"In France , sunflower has other assets : oleic varieties on more than 50 % surfaces , well organized supply chain , main seeds companies research centres , involvement of INRA , good adaptation to the environmental requirements."
FR2014010232,"But , for 20 years , mean seed yields have lightly increased which contributed to a large fall of the acreages ( now stabilized to 700 000 hectares ) and to their concentration in two regions : South - West and West - Atlantic."
FR2014010232,"Productivity improvement seems essential : it first needs the breeding of high yielding varieties with a good disease tolerance but also the setting of complete crop management system ( variety , date of sowing , planting densityâ € ¦ ) adapted to different situations."
FR2014010232,"Because of the environmental context , it seems necessary to carry out studies on the new systems for weed control with post emergence herbicides , mechanical weed control , wheatsunflower intercrop cultivation and adaptation to climate change."
FR2014010232,"As far as oilseed processing and outlets are concerned , several research points should be considered to ensure the sustainability of this crop."
FR2014003240,"In Guadeloupe and Martinique , banana production is challenged to better combine economic and environmental performance."
FR2014003240,"While different agro-ecological innovations are being developed , we evaluated a range of innovations and their conditions of adoption in different types of farm."
FR2014003240,Field surveys and simulations show that small family farms should rotate bananas fields with a culture of pineapple or a service crop like Brachiaria decumbens.
FR2014003240,"Nevertheless , some obstacles related to small areas coupled with liquidity constraints may limit adoptions."
FR2014003240,"To overcome these constraints , we propose the introduction of economic measures to support conversion."
FR2014003240,"Generally , innovative systems studied lead to a substitution of pesticide use by more work."
FR2014003240,"In the case of intercropping techniques , this substitution generally reduces income of farmers."
FR2014003240,"In mountain areas , spontaneous fallow practices and implementation of intercropping with legume Canavalia ensiformis or Impatiens sp seem most appropriate."
FR2014003240,"For large farms , whose economic and environmental performance are already relatively high , the cropping system based on the use of Brachiaria decumbens in fallow and then in intercropping seems the most promising option."
CN2012000550,"Heterosis , a complicated phenomenon , is jointly controlled by physiological , biochemical and molecular mechanisms."
CN2012000550,"At population level , crop yield depends on the coordination between crop and its environment , individual plant and its population , different organs in an individual."
CN2012000550,Hybridization breeding pursues the heterosis in a population level.
CN2012000550,"At individual level , the cross breeding intends to achieve the collection of the characters which are in favor of an individual yield formation in particular population condition."
CN2012000550,"This collection consists of the characters of positive heterosis , negative heterosis and zero heterosis."
CN2012000550,"The basis of genetic changes in hyrbids , caused by crossing , may be classified into three categories : the parents having the same alleles , the parents having different alleles , the parents having different non-allele genes."
CN2012000550,"Heterosis is the result of combination and concord expression of these three categories of genes , which could be called the concord gene expression profile."
CN2012000550,The creation of this gene expression profile is involved in the following gene recombination of three stages : ( 1 ) crossing when establishing an inbed population ; ( 2 ) self - pollination when screening the inbed population ; ( 3 ) crossing when screening the combinations of inbred lines.
CN2012000550,"According to the molecular mechanism of heterosis , not only the complementarity , but also the consistency in the genetic composition are necessary between the inbred lines of parent possessing high combining ability."
CN2012000550,These breeding objectives can be achieved by the recycling selection of the inbreds in face - to - face direction.
CN2012000550,"Meanwhile it is necessary to investigate the characteristics and the establishment pattern of the concord gene expression profile , and to explore the relationship between the concord gene expression profile and the phenotype."
CN2012000550,"Especially , we should pay more attention to the relation of complementarity and consistency in the genetic composition with the traits controlled by them , and screen out the molecular marks used to predict the heterosis."
CN2012000550,"Consequently , these investigations can provide new approaches and theoretical guidance for heterosis which will laya foundation for the further heterosis utilisation."

PH2013000528,The fecundity pattern generated by the three parasitoid species changed due to the competition.
PH2013000528,H. varicornis fecundity increased two times more than normal circumstances.
PH2013000528,While O.liriomyzae offset the increase in fecundity of H. varicornis by increased egg laying when the capability of H. varicornis decreased.
PH2013000528,"While G. micromorpha is not able to maintain the rate of egg laying comparable to the two other parasitoid species , however , to stay afloat and maintain the viability of offspring , the competitive strategy used by G. micromorpha is by ovipositing for a lifetime."

FR2014014115,"In this regard , and initially based on review of the literature , we look at the ongoing interaction between these two styles of agricultural practices."
FR2014014115,"We then move on to analyze emerging controversies and present a synthesis of two case studies which illustrate the practical applications of agro-ecological principles , evaluating practices and ethical values and relating them to familial or entrepreneurial logics of production."
FR2014014115,We conclude that the relations between agricultural styles can not be reduced to a simple opposition between a scientific field and a practical domain.
FR2014014115,"A variety of elements must be taken into account , amongst which we emphasize the degree of socio - cultural integration ( values ) to society , practices and market participation."
FR2014014115,"Studies within Brazil provide evidence of the diversity of current relationships , whether inclusive or exclusive , and of the fluidity marking concepts of agro-ecology and organic agriculture."
DJ2012073508,In the recent past there has been concern to address the declining trends and deteriorating ecological elements and their functions in productive agricultural landscapes.
DJ2012073508,"The efforts to revive the ecological functions needs multiple scale approach , which include scientific understanding , time dependent restorative activities and incorporation of wisdom of the stakeholders."
DJ2012073508,Conservation initiatives linked to precision farming is an apt mechanism to minimize the loss of natural resources of agricultural landscapes to maintain the complex stabilizers of ecological functions.
DJ2012073508,Such an effort must address the scientific evaluation of the farm as â € œecologically sustainable unitâ € with due consideration to social construct at local to regional level.
DJ2012073508,Sustainability indices can be useful tools for evaluating the farms to isolate degradative factors and identify ecologically conservative practices.
DJ2012073508,This review will analyze certain inter-linked concepts relevant to address the sustainability issues in agro-ecology at the interface of socio - ecological perspective.
CN2013000814,"The carbon ( C ) , nitrogen ( N ) and phosphorus ( P ) variations of a temperate wetland soil under continuous cultivation for 40 yr were determined and evaluated in the Sanjiang Plain , Northeast China."
CN2013000814,"The results showed that the soil organic carbon ( SOC ) and total nitrogen ( TN ) contents in each soil layer decreased sharply after cultivation for 2 - 3 yr , and exhibited minor differences after cultivation for 11 yr , which showed an exponential decline curve with the increase of cultivation years."
CN2013000814,"The reduction rates of carbon and nitrogen reserves were 14.79 % and 28.53 % yr - 1 at the initial reclamation stages of 2 - 3 yr and then decreased to 2.02 - 3.08 % yr - 1 and 1.98 - 2.93 % yr - 1 after cultivation for 20 yr , respectively."
CN2013000814,"Soil total phosphorus ( TP ) reserves decreased within cultivation for 5 yr , and then gradually restored to the initial level after cultivation for 17 yr."
CN2013000814,"Both SOC and TN could be restored slightly when the farmland was left fallow for 8 yr after reclamation for 11 yr , whereas TP had no significant difference."
CN2013000814,"These results demonstrated that wetland cultivation was one of the most important factors influencing on the nutrient fate and reserves in soil , which could lead to the rapid nutrient release and slow restoration through abandon cultivation , therefore protective cultivation techniques preventing nutrients from loss should be immediately established after wetland reclamation."
XF2006450127,"The global demand for modern bioenergy , and especially liquid biofuels , is rapidly growing , driven mainly by climate change mitigation policies and increasing oil prices."
XF2006450127,This creates both opportunities and risks for developing countries.
XF2006450127,"On the one hand , modern bioenergy development can boost both agricultural and rural development by raising agricultural productivity , creating new employment and income - generating opportunities , and improving access to modern energy services in rural areas."
XF2006450127,"On the other hand , if not properly managed , modern bioenergy development can trigger a number of negative environmental and socio - economic impacts , for instance by putting pressure on key resources such as land and water.The environmental and socio - economic sustainability of modern bioenergy has been highly debated over the past few years."
XF2006450127,One of the most controversial issues that has dominated this debate is the relationship between bioenergy and food security.
XF2006450127,"In order to shed light on this complex issue and help policy - makers understand and manage the risks and opportunities for food security associated with various bioenergy development pathways , the Bioenergy and Food Security ( BEFS ) project of the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) of the United Nations developed an Analytical Framework and a toolbox , which are being implemented in several countries."
XF2006450127,"Building on this work , FAOâ € ™ s Bioenergy and Food Security Criteria and Indicators ( BEFSCI ) project has developed a set of criteria , indicators , good practices and policy options on sustainable bioenergy development that foster rural development and food security."
XF2006450127,"BEFSCI aims to inform the development of national frameworks aimed at preventing the risk of negative impacts â € “ and increasing the opportunities â € “ of bioenergy development on food security , and help developing countries monitor and respond to the impacts of bioenergy development on food security.In order to ensure that modern bioenergy development is sustainable and that it safeguards food security , a number of good practices can be implemented throughout the bioenergy supply chain."
XF2006450127,"Drawing from FAOâ € ™ s work on good practices in agriculture and forestry , the BEFSCI project has compiled a set of good environmental practices that bioenergy feedstock producers can adopt in order to minimize the risk of negative environmental impacts from their operations and to ensure that modern bioenergy delivers on its climate change mitigation potential."
XF2006450127,"These practices can improve the efficiency and sustainability in the use of land , water and agricultural inputs for bioenergy production , thus reducing the potential competition with food production."
XF2006450127,"Although the focus of this report is on bioenergy , the practices described in it are relevant for any agricultural and forestry production , regardless of the use of the feedstocks."
CZ2014000415,Collecting information about crop wild relatives ( CWRs ) as vital genetic resources for food security is the first stage of monitoring them.
CZ2014000415,"In this study , which was conducted in a protected area , we surveyed the conservation status of CWR sand , and the interaction between the condition of these plants and their local use."
CZ2014000415,"From 338 plant species in the area , 179 crop wild relatives in 38 families were identified."
CZ2014000415,"None of them is threatened , but some endemic rare or vulnerable plants such as Alkanna frigida Boiss."
CZ2014000415,could cause some anxiety.
CZ2014000415,Among these species 19 species of CWRs have edible usage in this area.
CZ2014000415,Harvesting the crop wild relatives from nature by the local people is seen as a conservative factor although this is not usually true of other species.
CN2013001510,[ Objective ] The aim was to explore the Phylogenetic Relationships of Caragana ( Fabaceae ) by the Use of nrITS Sequences.
CN2013001510,[ Method ] Internal transcribed spacer ( ITS ) sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA ( nrDNA ) from 29 taxa of Caragana species and seven close relatives ( all belong to Astralinae ( Adens ) Benth ) were used for phylogenetic analysis.
CN2013001510,[ Result ] Length of the entire ITS region ranges from 611 to 614 bp in Caragana species.
CN2013001510,"The aligned sequences nrITS of Caragana are 655bp , and 170 sites are variable , with 107 phylogenetically informative sites."
CN2013001510,The phylogenetically informative sites are 16.3 % of the total aligned sequences.
CN2013001510,The ITS sequences data are useful to resolve some relationships at lower taxonomic levels within Caragana.
CN2013001510,The Caragana Fabr.
CN2013001510,is not a monophyletic group with very close connection with Calophaca tianschanica.
CN2013001510,The ITS data reveal that the species of Sect.
CN2013001510,tragacanthoides were dispersed in MP tree or ME tree.
CN2013001510,"Although the morphology of C. ordosica is similar to C. tibetica , the ITS results revealed an unexpectedly close relativeship to C. roborovskyi."
CN2013001510,"The ITS data also indicate C. davazamcii , C. korshinskii , C. intermedia , and C. microphylla are different species."
CN2013001510,[ Conclusion ] ITS sequences have an important reference value in exploring the relationships of Caragana.
PH2014000119,"A 2 - yr study was conducted at the teaching and research farm of the Department of Crops Science , University of Nigeria , Nsukka to determine the effect of time of planting on growth and yield of sesame."
PH2014000119,The study determined the optimum time of sowing sesame in the derived savanna agroecology of southeastern Nigeria and identified high - yielding sesame accessions for the zone.
PH2014000119,"Three sowing dates ( July 22nd , Aug 22nd and Sept 22nd ) were tested in 2009 while in 2010 , the planting dates were June 22nd , July 22nd and Aug 22nd."
PH2014000119,"Four sesame accessions ( Zuru , NCRI - BEN 01 M , 43 -9-1 and NCRI - BEN 03L ) were also evaluated in both years."
PH2014000119,"Based on the results , time of sowing had a significant effect on growth and yield of sesame."
PH2014000119,"Plant height , number of leaves , stem girth and number of branches per plant decreased with delay in time of sowing."
PH2014000119,Early sowing in the season significantly increased grain yield for all accessions.
PH2014000119,"Grain yield decreased by 42 % and 91 % as sowing was delayed from July to Aug and Sept , respectively , in 2009 season."
PH2014000119,"In 2010 season , grain yield decreased by 16 % and 32 % as sowing was delayed from June to July and Aug , respectively."
PH2014000119,"Though seed yield in the accessions did not differ significantly , Zuru had the highest performance in both years."
PH2014000119,"Among the climatic factors , rainfall appeared to contribute more to changes in performance across sowing dates."
CZ2012000688,"A factorial nitrogen x phosphorus addition experiment was conducted to evaluate responses of leaf nutrient resorption to increased soil N and P availability in a semiarid grassland in Keerqin Sandy Lands , China."
CZ2012000688,"Four plant species were selected , among which Artemisia scoparia and Chenopodium acuminatum were dominant species in the control and P - added plots , and Cannabis sativa and Phragmites communis were dominant in the N - and N + P - treated plots."
CZ2012000688,Our results showed that N and P resorption varied substantially among species ( P less than 0.01 ).
CZ2012000688,A general trend of decrease in N resorption efficiency ( NRE ) and N resorption proficiency ( NRP ) was observed in response to increased soil N availability for all species with the exception of P. communis only for NRE.
CZ2012000688,"Similarly , P resorption proficiency ( PRP ) decreased in response to P addition for all species , whereas P resorption efficiency ( PRE ) was not affected by P addition."
CZ2012000688,"Species responded differently in terms of PRE and PRP to N addition , whereas no changes in NRE and NRP occurred in response to P addition with the exception of P. communis for NRE."
CZ2012000688,Our results suggest that increased soil nutrient availability can influence plant - mediated nutrient cycling directly by changing leaf nutrient resorption and indirectly by altering species composition in the sandy grassland.
PK2013000774,"Studies were conducted to investigate the effect of naphthalene acetic acid ( NAA ) and irrigation regimes on the productivity of rice under the agro-ecology of Dera Ismail Khan , Pakistan."
PK2013000774,"Four levels ( 0 , 60 , 90 , 120 ml per ha ) of naphthalene acetic acid with four irrigation regimes viz. I1 ( 60 cm ) , I2 ( 75 cm ) , I3 ( 90 cm ) and I4 ( 105 cm ) were assessed during rice growing seasons ( 2004 - 2005 )."
PK2013000774,"Results revealed that the highest number of panicles , spikelets per panicle , normal kernels , grain weight , paddy yield and water productivity was recorded by applying naphthalene acetic acid @ 90 ml."
PK2013000774,per ha and I2 ( 75 cm ) level of irrigation water ( 10 irrigations ).
PK2013000774,"These results clearly indicated that application of naphthalene acetic acid was found very effective alone and in combination , improving the yield and yield components of rice considerably."
QL2013000139,"To keep pace with growing populations and dietary changes , food production in the Greater Mekong Subregion ( GMS ) will need to increase by an estimated 25 % over the next 15 years."
QL2013000139,"The majority of agricultural production systems in the GMS are rainfed ; upgrading these systems promises large social , economic and environmental paybacks in terms of reducing poverty and boosting economic development."
QL2013000139,This study was commissioned by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency ( Sida ) to investigate opportunities for improving production in rainfed agriculture in the GMS through small - scale water management interventions.Agroecosystems of the GMS can be described using six zones with broadly similar biophysical conditions and farming systems.
QL2013000139,"Farming systems in the GMS fall into two distinct groups : â € ˜lowlandâ € ™ systems , where inundated rice production predominates , and â € ˜uplandâ € ™ systems , where rice and a mix of other crops are grown under non-flooded ( aerobic ) conditions."
QL2013000139,"Both systems exist in all Agro-Ecological Zones ( AEZs ) , distributed according to local topography."
QL2013000139,"Generally , inundated rice systems predominate in the deltas and lowland plains , while upland systems dominate in the sloping uplands and highlands.Annual rainfall is more than adequate to support rainfed cropping throughout the GMS , but its highly seasonal distribution , driven by the southwest monsoon , means the growing season is restricted to six to eight months of the year."
QL2013000139,Producing crops during the dry season requires some degree of water management.
QL2013000139,The distinction between irrigated and rainfed cropping in lowland systems is often blurred.
QL2013000139,"Growing lowland rice intrinsically involves water management to maintain inundated conditions , but most of the wet - season crop is rainfed in the sense that the water used mainly comes from rainfall , or from the recession of seasonal floods."
QL2013000139,"On average , more than half of crop water requirements for irrigated crops come from rainfall."
QL2013000139,"Because of the importance of flood - recession agriculture , water levels in the major rivers are as important to rainfed cropping as it is to irrigated crop production."
QL2013000139,"Hydrological drought caused by low flood extent can be as important for rainfed crops as local rainfall deficits.Analyses of the suitability of major crops show that most crops are constrained in terms of rainfall , emphasizing the critical importance of water management in regional production."
QL2013000139,"Indica - type paddy rice , the regionâ € ™ s major crop , is highly sensitive to water availability and is thus only suitable for cultivation with careful water management."
QL2013000139,"In lowland locations where water supply is assured throughout the season , rice systems can be highly productive."
QL2013000139,"However , for many marginal rainfed lowland rice systems , there is a high risk that there will be insufficient water for a good yield."
QL2013000139,"Other important crops , including maize , sugarcane and , to a lesser extent , cassava , are only marginally suitable in terms of precipitation."
QL2013000139,Growing these crops carries high production risks and the need to assure water for the crop through soil water management and supplementary irrigation.
QL2013000139,"The analyses highlight risks involved in the rapid spread of rubber and coffee as plantation crops in the region , since both these crops are constrained by their temperature and rainfall requirements , and are unsuitable for cultivation over wide areas.There is significant variation in productivity from different farming systems , reflected in differences in yield across AEZs and between countries."
QL2013000139,"Gains in yields across a range of crops over the last 20 years are the result of water management , improved varieties and better agronomic practices."
QL2013000139,"The largest yield gaps are in two areas : the cultivation of lowland rice in traditional wet - season paddy systems on the lowland plains of Cambodia , northeast Thailand , Lao PDR and Myanmar ; and upland agriculture , across a range of crop types , reflecting difficult agricultural conditions in sloping lands with poor soils."
QL2013000139,"Water management is a critical first step in improving yields ; when water - related risks are reduced , farmers are more willing to invest in other yield - increasing strategies."
QL2013000139,"A wide range of technologies and approaches have been developed to manage water in agricultural systems , and there is a continuum between rainfed and irrigated systems."
QL2013000139,"Agricultural Water Management ( AWM ) interventions fall into three broad classes : measures to reduce water use or on - farm demand ; measures to control and / or increase water supply ( including , but not only based on , irrigation ) ; and enabling or accompanying measures."
QL2013000139,"Water management interventions might not be designed specifically to improve yields , but directed towards diversification , with aims to improve overall production and revenues by providing biological and economic resilience."
QL2013000139,It is important to work across scales to identify where gains in production can be made most effectively.
QL2013000139,"Collective small - scale interventions may be able to achieve similar outcomes to large - scale projects , but with lower costs and greater ownership and involvement."
QL2013000139,"Identifying appropriate management interventions must be done in context , taking into consideration the farming system , physical environment , socioeconomic and cultural factors , and community dynamics."
QL2013000139,Effective water management should be tailored to the specific condition of each field and farmer.
QL2013000139,Consultation with local stakeholders is essential.
QL2013000139,"Water is inextricably linked to processes in the wider landscape , and the cumulative effects of multiple small - scale interventions and land - use decisions can have significant impacts on the way water is transmitted and retained at catchment scales."
QL2013000139,"AWM interventions should be seen in the context of improving the overall capacity of the landscape to provide water storage , stabilize and increase production and water buffers , and strengthen resilience to climate variability.Groundwater use for agriculture in the GMS is limited , accounting for less than 10 % of total irrigated area , although there has been a rapid expansion in the number of small pumps over the last 10 or 20 years."
QL2013000139,Groundwater provides significant advantages over formal surface water irrigation systems in terms of flexibility and lower infrastructure costs.
QL2013000139,"The potential for expansion of groundwater use is high , particularly in the large alluvial systems of the regionâ € ™ s major rivers , where groundwater is seasonally recharged by the annual flood in â € ˜underground natural irrigation systemsâ € ™."
QL2013000139,"In some systems , there are opportunities for enhancing groundwater availability through managed aquifer recharge."
QL2013000139,"A comprehensive assessment of the options available for , and barriers to , increasing the use of groundwater is a high priority for the region.A defining feature of the agricultural systems in the GMS is the rapid pace of change , driven by a complex mix of large - scale forces and unplanned individual land - use choices."
QL2013000139,"Given the need for farmers to shift rapidly in response to external forces and adjust to new environments and conditions , strengthening the populationâ € ™ s capacity to adapt and developing supporting institutions is a high priority."
QL2013000139,Discussions regarding sustainability need to consider how landscapes can function effectively while supporting a variety of cropping and farming systems.
QL2013000139,"They must , therefore , focus on the fundamental ecosystem services that support agricultural production , such as soil fertility , nutrient cycling , water cycling and pollination services , rather than only taking into account the potential for individual crops."
QL2013000139,"To illustrate the range of issues inherent in identifying and implementing AWM interventions in different systems , six case studies are presented as follows : Farm ponds in northeast Thailand , Integretes soil and water conservation in Hoa Binh , Vietnam , Small reservoirs in Chammar Krom , Tonle Sap , Cambodia , Coping with drought in Yunnan , China , Shallow groundwater tube wells in Svay Rieng , Cambodia , Terraces for montane paddy in Luang Prabang , Lao PDR."
QL2013000139,nterventions for AWM are specific to local conditions and context.
QL2013000139,"In any system , a diverse range of measures may be needed to address issues at different scales , and to provide farmers with flexibility in terms of cost and production options."
QL2013000139,"While many measures will be implemented on - farm , supporting actions may be required at community or watershed level , and appropriate policies and institutions are required."
FR2013100347,"Smallholder farmers in semi-arid Africa are in an increasingly vulnerable position due to the direct and indirect effects of climate change , demographic pressure and resource degradation."
FR2013100347,Conservation agriculture ( CA ) is promoted as an alternative to restore soil productivity through increased water and nutrient use efficiencies in these regions.
FR2013100347,"However , adoption of CA is low due to a number of technical reasons , but fundamentally due to the fact that CA has been often promoted as a package , without proper adaptation to local circumstances."
FR2013100347,"Farmers engagement in designing and implementing locally suited CA practices , as part of a long term strategy of soil rehabilitation is the core approach followed by the ABACO initiative , which brings together scientists and practitioners from West , East and Southern Africa coordinated through the African Conservation Tillage Network ( www.act-africa.org )."
FR2013100347,"ABACO relies on agro-ecologically intensive measures for soil rehabilitation and increased water productivity in semiarid regions , implemented , tested and disseminated through local co-innovation platforms."
FR2013100347,"Rather than using rigid definitions of CA approaches that might not work in all sites , ABACO proposes to explore best engagement approaches for different sites."
FR2013100347,"Simulation modelling is used as a support of long - term cross scale tradeoffs analysis from field to farms and territories , in order to inform effective policy - making."
FR2013100347,"Preliminary results form the field are used here to illustrate and discuss the principles of ABACO , which may apply as well to regions other than semi-arid Africa."
BG2013000334,"A detailed analysis on the distribution of parent rocks in Bulgaria , their genetic and post genetic interrelation and their specific influence on soil processes and soil formation has been carried out."

BG2013000334,"A critical approach in the examination of the influence of different geochemical anomalies , barriers and pools has been used."
BG2013000334,The red soils in Bulgaria have been characterised as a unique geological phenomenon.
BG2013000334,It has been estimated that the huge soil - geological variety is a basis for agroecosystems formation and the differentiation of the 50 agroecological regions in the country.
BG2013000334,On this basis a new definition of the scientific discipline Agroecology has been proposed.

RU2012000443,The depletion of ozone layer can result in increasing the intensity of ultraviolet emission ( UVE ).
RU2012000443,The study to discover the biological exposure of UVE to natural phytocoenoses and agricultural crops has been conducted since the 1950 's.
RU2012000443,The similar experiments are methodically justified to be done in field conditions but not in conditions of frame area.
RU2012000443,"As found , UVE influences a plant at every level of its organization , in particular , causes morphophysiological changes , alters the hormonal status , induces DNA injuries."
RU2012000443,The UVE sensitivity greatly depends on an ontogenesis genotype and stage.
RU2012000443,Usually in studies a concept of biologically effective UVE is used allowing thereby comparing dependencies between a dose and effect for solar and artificial UVE.
RU2012000443,In the modern experiments it is shown that the contribution of region A UVE to the total biological effect was earlier undervalued.
RU2012000443,The earlier calculations mainly involved UVE exposure in region B.
RU2012000443,The simulation of the depletion of ozone layer predicted a great loss of yields pf some agricultural crops â € “ up to 50 %.
RU2012000443,"With reference to the newly received data , the loss can be even greater , as the spectral composition of lampas used in these experiments simulated the depletion of ozone layer not 30 % as supposed , but only 8 %."
RU2012000443,"However , the mutagenic activity of UVE is really determined by the exposure of primarily region B rays."
RU2012000443,"According to the recommendations of the International Commission on Illumination ( CIE ) , the spectral sensitivity of biological tissues and a detector used in the experiment to a UVE wavelength should fit together."
RU2012000443,It has been concluded that the methodology of simulating the UVE exposure to plants is extremely important for adequate prediction of the yield loss and needs improving.
FR2014016890,"Since the 1950â € ™ s , labour productivity growth in dairy production systems in Bocage of VendÃ © e has been based on specialization and increase in milk production per hectare and per worker."
FR2014016890,"Grazing time has been reduced , giving place to conserved forage , mainly maize silage."

SK2013000143,Water erosion has been recognized as a major soil degradation process worldwide.
SK2013000143,This is of special relevance in the semi-arid areas of South Bulgaria with long periods of drought along with severe rainfall events.
SK2013000143,The main objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of Bromus innermis L. and Lotus corniculatus L. for soil protection purposes under different site conditions.
SK2013000143,"The site parameters considered were slope , fertilization and a range of soil physical parameters."
SK2013000143,"The plant parameters were canopy cover , biomass , and root morphological characteristics."
SK2013000143,The experiment includes plots without and with eleven rates of NPK fertilization on gentle ( 6deg ) and steep slopes ( 12deg ).
SK2013000143,It was observed that the effect of fertilization on shoot and root growth was stronger on the gentle than on the steep slopes.
SK2013000143,The biomass accumulation was more sensitive to N than the PK fertilizer applications.
SK2013000143,The increase of the root density with increasing fertilization rates was more pronounced for the mass than for length or surface area.

AL1013100014,"A virus disease survey was carried out between the months of October and November 2011 , in thirty locations of the guinea savanna and rain forest agroecologies of Kwara State Nigeria with the objective of evaluating the incidence and severity of cowpea viruses."
AL1013100014,"The virus incidence ( VI ) , on cowpea were estimated based on fifty plant observations per field and virus severity ( VS ) , was scored on a scale of 1 - 5 based on the percentage number of leaves per plant showing virus symptoms."
AL1013100014,The results indicated that virus incidence were higher in the rain forest agroecology ( 79 % - 90 % ) compared with the guinea savannah agroecology ( 43 % - 73 % ).
AL1013100014,The severity index value were however similar irrespective of the agroecology.
AL1013100014,The findings indicate the need for the sustainable management of virus diseases which in this study has been found to be rampant and therefore could cause crop yield reductions.
AL1013100014,It is important to curb the menace of these viruses since cowpea is an important food source for the rural poor.
AL1013100014,"It is therefore expedient to imbibe eco-friendly , cost effective and sustainable management practices to control the viral pathogens."
AL1013100014,This would enhance food security and cause the reduction in poverty levels among rural dwellers in a developing country like Nigeria.
CZ2014000324,Climate change could promote the altitudinal spread of C4 weed species since they can benefit from warmer climate.
CZ2014000324,The effects of altitude and climatic conditions ( the sum of temperatures above 5 deg C and precipitation ) on the biomass and seed production of two annual C4 weeds - Amaranthus retroflexus and Echinochloa crus - galli were studied in the Czech Republic.
CZ2014000324,We included both temperature and precipitation variables in the study since they both serve as basic indicators of climate change and thus they have the greatest impact on plant development.
CZ2014000324,The experiment was carried out by sowing both weed species on square m area with four replicates in seven localities differing in altitude in 2010 and 2011.
CZ2014000324,We found no significant impacts due to altitude on any variables measured.
CZ2014000324,"However , climatic factors explained 44.5 % of the variation in plant dry biomass and 41.4 % of the seed number produced by A. retroflexus."
CZ2014000324,The same variables did not significantly contribute to the variation in above - ground biomass or seed number of E. crus - galli.
CZ2014000324,These results show the impact of climate conditions to vary between species and not to limit reproduction at high altitudes.

FR2016206509,"Agroecology and industrial ecology can be viewed as complementary means for reducing the environmental footprint of animal farming systems : agroecology mainly by stimulating natural processes to reduce inputs , and industrial ecology by closing system loops , thereby reducing demand for raw materials , lowering pollution and saving on waste treatment."
FR2016206509,"Surprisingly , animal farming systems have so far been ignored in most agroecological thinking."
FR2016206509,"On the basis of a study by Altieri , who identified the key ecological processes to be optimized , we propose five principles for the design of sustainable animal production systems : ( i ) adopting management practices aiming to improve animal health , ( ii ) decreasing the inputs needed for production , ( iii ) decreasing pollution by optimizing the metabolic functioning of farming systems , ( iv ) enhancing diversity within animal production systems to strengthen their resilience and ( v ) preserving biological diversity in agroecosystems by adapting management practices."
FR2016206509,"We then discuss how these different principles combine to generate environmental , social and economic performance in six animal production systems ( ruminants , pigs , rabbits and aquaculture ) covering a long gradient of intensification."
FR2016206509,"The two principles concerning economy of inputs and reduction of pollution emerged in nearly all the case studies , a finding that can be explained by the economic and regulatory constraints affecting animal production."
FR2016206509,"Integrated management of animal health was seldom mobilized , as alternatives to chemical drugs have only recently been investigated , and the results are not yet transferable to farming practices."
FR2016206509,"A number of ecological functions and ecosystem services ( recycling of nutrients , forage yield , pollination , resistance to weed invasion , etc. ) are closely linked to biodiversity , and their persistence depends largely on maintaining biological diversity in agroecosystems."

FR2016228861,Agroecology is a subject that has gained importance in the scientific domain since the last two decades.
FR2016228861,"The use of the term agroecology in the scientific literature increased 60 % in the last five years , comparing to its first citation in 1928 until 2007."
FR2016228861,In this bibliography our objective is to study the evolution of the concepts of agroecology taking into account these two dimensions : a science and a practice.
FR2016228861,"As conclusion , we understand that the domain of agroecology concerns a lot more than a range of agricultural practices."
FR2016228861,"Different , it searches to understand and to mitigate the social , economic and environmental consequences of modern agriculture , even as to legitimate the important role of agroecology in the food production."
GB2013100110,"In Ethiopia food production lags behind while population growth increase , poor management of Soil and Water , poor agronomic practices and environmental degradation are wide spread."
GB2013100110,"In the study area , agriculture depends on rain water ; however rain water is not evenly distributed spatially and temporally."
GB2013100110,"The general objective of the study is to assess agro-ecology , and crop management practices effect on crop water productivity of major crops."
GB2013100110,"The specific objectives of the study are : - To identify agro-ecologies of the study area according to local classification system , to map land use type of the rainy season , to identify the crop management practices and to evaluate crop water productivity of major crops across agro-ecologies of the study area."
GB2013100110,The results show that 66 % of the watershed is not cultivated while 34 % is cultivated.
GB2013100110,"According to local classification system there are three agro ecology zones ( Upper zone , Middle Zone and Lower Zone )."
GB2013100110,"Middle zone is more productive than lower zone and Upper zone agro ecologies , maize ( Zea mays ) and teff ( Eragrostis teff ) are more productive crops while sesame and niger seed are less productive both physically and economically , improved varieties are more productive than local varieties , maximum tillage frequency in the area is four , increase in tillage frequency increased productivity , and precursor crops affect crop water productivity."
GB2013100110,"Physical and economic crop water productivity depends on agro ecology , crop type , crop variety , tillage frequency and precursor crops."
GB2013100110,"So less productive agro ecologies need to be managed properly , maize and tef need to be cultivated to get better economic value , improved crop varieties need to be cultivated to get more physical and economic productivity , to some extent increase in tillage frequency is needed and precursor crops need consideration before planting."
FR2014012096,"Leaf nitrogen and leaf surface area influence the exchange of gases between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere , and play a significant role in the global cycles of carbon , nitrogen and water."
FR2014012096,"The purpose of this study is to use field - based and satellite remote - sensing - based methods to assess leaf nitrogen pools in five diverse European agricultural landscapes located in Denmark , Scotland ( United Kingdom ) , Poland , the Netherlands and Italy."
FR2014012096,REGFLEC ( REGularized canopy reFLECtance ) is an advanced image - based inverse canopy radiative transfer modelling system which has shown proficiency for regional mapping of leaf area index ( LAI ) and leaf chlorophyll ( CHL1 ) using remote sensing data.
FR2014012096,"In this study , high spatial resolution ( 10 - 20 m ) remote sensing images acquired from the multispectral sensors aboard the SPOT ( Satellite For Observation of Earth ) satellites were used to assess the capability of REGFLEC for mapping spatial variations in LAI , CHL1 and the relation to leaf nitrogen ( N - 1 ) data in five diverse European agricultural landscapes."
FR2014012096,REGFLEC is based on physical laws and includes an automatic model parameterization scheme which makes the tool independent of field data for model calibration.
FR2014012096,"In this study , REGFLEC performance was evaluated using LAI measurements and non-destructive measurements ( using a SPAD meter ) of leaf - scale CHL1 and N - 1 concentrations in 93 fields representing crop - and grasslands of the five landscapes."
FR2014012096,"Furthermore , empirical relationships between field measurements ( LAI , CHL1 and N - 1 ) and five spectral vegetation indices ( the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index , the Simple Ratio , the Enhanced Vegetation Index - 2 , the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index , and the green chlorophyll index ) were used to assess field data coherence and to serve as a comparison basis for assessing REGFLEC model performance."
FR2014012096,The field measurements showed strong vertical CHL1 gradient profiles in 26 % of fields which affected REGFLEC performance as well as the relationships between spectral vegetation indices ( SVIs ) and field measurements.
FR2014012096,"When the range of surface types increased , the REGFLEC results were in better agreement with field data than the empirical SVI regression models."
FR2014012096,"Selecting only homogeneous canopies with uniform CHL1 distributions as reference data for evaluation , REGFLEC was able to explain 69 % of LAI observations ( rmse = 0.76 ) , 46 % of measured canopy chlorophyll contents ( rmse = 719 mgm ( - 2 ) ) and 51 % of measured canopy nitrogen contents ( rmse = 2.7 gm ( - 2 ) )."
FR2014012096,"Better results were obtained for individual landscapes , except for Italy , where REGFLEC performed poorly due to a lack of dense vegetation canopies at the time of satellite recording."
FR2014012096,Presence of vegetation is needed to parameterize the REGFLEC model.
FR2014012096,"Combining REGFLEC - and SVI - based model results to minimize errors for a "" snap - shot "" assessment of total leaf nitrogen pools in the five landscapes , results varied from 0.6 to 4.0 t km ( - 2 )."

CZ2014000092,This study presents a detailed assessment of probability of later spring frosts and earlier autumn frosts when growing sugar beet in Central Bohemia in the period 1961 - 2011.
CZ2014000092,The probability of severe frost at a later date in the spring and an earlier date in the autumn and the length of the frost - free period were estimated.
CZ2014000092,"The results of probability analysis show a decreasing risk of frosts , especially in May and September , with extension of the frost - free season in the autumn , which has a significantly positive effect on the yield of sugar beet."
CZ2014000092,"In Central Bohemia , at altitudes up to 250 m , with the highest concentration of sugar beet production areas , the occurrence of frosts in May is very dangerous for young sugar beet plants and it occurs approximately once in 10 years ; at altitudes from 250 to 300 m , the risk is significantly higher at once in 4 years."
CZ2014000092,"On average , the onset of autumn frost occurs regardless of altitude in the second and third decades of October."
CZ2014000092,"In the regions with the highest concentration of sown area of sugar beet , i.e. , lowlands and hilly terrain of Central Bohemia , the frost - fee season is , on average , 186 or 180 days long."
CZ2014000092,This corresponds to the average length of the growing season of sugar beet.
QL2018000181,"Climate change poses one of the gravest risks to mankind as it affects a wide variety of socio - economic activities , important to world food security."
QL2018000181,Agriculture is one of the most important sectors vulnerable to climate change.
QL2018000181,"Agricultural production is sensitive to climate change , and food security is sensitive to agricultural production."
QL2018000181,"Climate abnormalities such as perpetual droughts , floods , heat waves , and rainfall failure can have devastating consequences for agricultural production and the impacts could be immediately transmitted to food security and livelihoods."
QL2018000181,This chapter attempted to assess the short - run economic impacts of climate change ( change in the levels of temperature and precipitation ) with a focus on the Ethiopian economy.
QL2018000181,"In doing so , it uses a computable general equilibrium ( CGE ) model based on the 2005/06 Ethiopian Social Accounting Matrix."
QL2018000181,One of the innovative approaches of this study is the explicit inclusion of different agro-ecological zones ( AEZs ) of the country in estimating the likely effects of climate change.
QL2018000181,The results of the CGE model simulation show that climate change has a dampening effect on economic growth and many key macroeconomic indicators.
QL2018000181,Investment is the only macroeconomic variable that increases despite the changes in climate.
QL2018000181,"For instance , for a 3.260 C increase in temperature and a 12.02 mm decline in precipitation which will result in a 9.71 % loss in crop production , the CGE model simulation indicated that real GDP declines by 3.83 %."
QL2018000181,"Moreover , almost all sectoral activities are affected negatively and different agro-ecologies are affected differently."
QL2018000181,"For instance , the highland part of the country , which is the main producer of food crops , is severely affected compared to other AEZs in terms of agricultural production."
QL2018000181,"The findings further revealed that household livelihoods ( measured in terms of real income and welfare ) are negatively affected , and the effect is unevenly distributed across different household groups."
QL2018000181,The highest losses in income and welfare are likely to be incurred by the poor households that are residing in smaller urban centers.
QL2018000181,"Thus , the results of this study call for improved climate adaptation actions at farm level and beyond for reducing both economic decline and welfare loss and enhancing resilience."
QL2018000181,These results also provide critical information for informing economic policy on climate change and achieving food security.

RU2014000100,"Conclusions : threshold phytotoxic concentrations of copper of the growth indicators of lettuce were : for sod podzol loamy sand soil â € “ 200 mg / kg , low - leached hard - loamy chernozem â € “ 500 mg / kg , peat bog lowland soil â € “ 750-1500 mg / kg , dark chestnut soil â € “ 1000 mg / kg of soil."
FR2014001680,"Ongoing intensification and specialisation of livestock production lead to increasing volumes of manure to be managed , which are a source of the greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) methane ( CH4 ) and nitrous oxide ( N2O )."
FR2014001680,Net emissions of CH4 and N2O result from a multitude of microbial activities in the manure environment.
FR2014001680,"Their relative importance depends not only on manure composition and local management practices with respect to treatment , storage and field application , but also on ambient climatic conditions."
FR2014001680,"The diversity of livestock production systems , and their associated manure management , is discussed on the basis of four regional cases ( Sub-Saharan Africa , Southeast Asia , China and Europe ) with increasing levels of intensification and priorities with respect to nutrient management and environmental regulation."
FR2014001680,"GHG mitigation options for production systems based on solid and liquid manure management are then presented , and potentials for positive and negative interactions between pollutants , and between management practices , are discussed."
FR2014001680,"The diversity of manure properties and environmental conditions necessitate a modelling approach for improving estimates of GHG emissions , and for predicting effects of management changes for GHG mitigation , and requirements for such a model are discussed."
FR2014001680,"Finally , we briefly discuss drivers for , and barriers against , introduction of GHG mitigation measures for livestock production."
FR2014001680,"There is no conflict between efforts to improve food and feed production , and efforts to reduce GHG emissions from manure management."
FR2014001680,"Growth in livestock populations are projected to occur mainly in intensive production systems where , for this and other reasons , the largest potentials for GHG mitigation may be found."
AL2013100062,"Experiment was conducted during 2011 to 2012 cropping season using potted plants , to evaluate the influence of weeding regime on sugarcane mosaic disease severity in selected improved sugarcane varieties from the University of Ilorin â € “ Nigeria sugarcane germplasm."
AL2013100062,The experiment was laid out following a split plot arrangement where the weeding regime constitutes the main plot and the sugarcane varieties were the subplot.
AL2013100062,"Disease parameters such as symptom manifestation , number of diseased leaves , percentage severity were measured."
AL2013100062,"Growth and yield parameters such as stalk length , number of leaves , number of tillers and yield parameters such as fresh and dry shoot weights , percentage dry matter at harvest were also measured."
AL2013100062,"Analysis of variance showed that percentage severity of sugarcane mosaic disease , increased in non-weeded plots compared with weeded plots."
AL2013100062,Twice weeding ( 52.1 % ) and the weed free plots ( 53.7 % ) had the significantly lowest severities.
AL2013100062,Varietal influence significantly influenced severity and variety NCO - 270 produced the significantly lowest severity ( 45.8 % ).
AL2013100062,"The interaction of weeding regime and variety indicated that variety CB36411 in the weed free plots , produced the lowest severity ( 33.5 % )."
AL2013100062,"Yield parameters showed that significantly highest shoot weight was recorded in the weed free plot , while variety NCO - 270 gave the highest fresh and dry shoot weights ( 254.8 g and 50.2 g respectively )."
AL2013100062,"The results indicate that variety NCO - 270 was the most tolerant and that weeding at least once in six months is required to mitigate the effect of sugarcane mosaic disease , as witnessed in significantly increased growth and yield attributes of plants in the weeded plots."
TR2014100007,The study was carried out to evaluate how farmers in Kyuso District have perceived and adapted to climate change.
TR2014100007,Data was collected from 246 farmers from six locations sampled out through a multistage and simple random sampling procedure.
TR2014100007,The Heckman probit model was fitted to the data to avoid sample selection bias since not every farmer who may perceive climate change responds by adapting.
TR2014100007,"The analysis revealed that 94 % of farmers in Kyuso District had a perception that climate was changing and as a result , 85 % of these farmers had responded by adapting."
TR2014100007,"In this regard , age of the household head , gender , education , farm experience , household size , distance to the nearest market , access to irrigation water , local agro-ecology , on and off farm income , access to information on climate change through extension services , access to credit , changes in temperature and precipitation were found to have significant influence on the probability of farmers to perceive and / or adapt to climate change."
TR2014100007,"With the level of perception to climate change being more than that of adaptation , the study suggests that more policy efforts should be geared towards helping farmers to adapt to climate change."
FR2014003589,The organic bread wheat market has been diversified over time through the emergence of different sale channels.
FR2014003589,Processors require organic bread wheat of higher quality and safety in order to meet the consumersâ € ™ demand.
FR2014003589,The overall objective of the AGTEC - Org project was to identify agronomical and technological ways to improve the performance of organic wheat and flour.
FR2014003589,"The findings would contribute to enhanced baking quality and nutritional value of organic flour , as well as prevention of mycotoxin contamination."
FR2014003589,The project involved 9 research centers or universities from 5 European countries for a total budget of about 1.5 million â ‚ ¬.
FR2014003589,More than 400 experimental treatments were analyzed from 23 agronomic trials and 4 lab - experiments on food technology.
FR2014003589,Choice of cultivar is an efficient way to obtain higher grain quality.
FR2014003589,Intercropping legumes ( grain or forage ) improves weed control and N availability for wheat crop or succeeding crop.
FR2014003589,Green manure can be an effective alternative to farmyard manure.
FR2014003589,Fertilization with organic fertilizers improves yield and quality when water is available.
FR2014003589,Reduced tillage affects soil fertility and wheat yield but has little effects on grain quality.
FR2014003589,Milling process strongly influences flour characteristics.
FR2014003589,Stone milling improves the nutritive value and flour characteristics remain very stable independently of the milling yield.
FR2014003589,"However , stone milling slightly raises DON levels."
FR2014003589,"Characteristics of flour produced by means of roller milling appear very dependent on milling yield , instead."
FR2014003589,Increasing milling yield with the aim of enriching nutritional quality has a detrimental effect on either safety ( DON ) or bread - making quality ( bread volume ).
FR2014003589,Debranning before milling has a very positive impact on flour safety by reducing its DON content by 50 %.
LV2016011960,There has been considerable research on organic carbon ( OC ) stocks in the upper layer of the soil but it has focused on semi-mechanistic predictions of OC stocks in the long term rather than on microbial processes acting on OC transformations.
LV2016011960,"Published data lack of reference concerning the modelling of the short - term exchanges between atmosphere , plants , rhizobia and other microorganisms of soil."
LV2016011960,We think it is because the mechanistic role of microorganisms is poorly considered in most of the existing models.
LV2016011960,"Compartmental theory is the most used to model the complex system of OC forms , with linear or no - linear propositions."
LV2016011960,"Sometimes , the models did not consider explicitly an active microbial compartment and were often over parameterized."
LV2016011960,"In contrast , the MOMOS proposition defined linearly the functional role of microorganisms with only a no - linear term linked to microbial respiration."
LV2016011960,"It uses only 7 kinetic parameters having a clear ecological definition and being related to climate ( all parameters ) , soil texture or pH ( microbial respiration ) , and biological properties of debris inputs ( enzymatic breakdown of plant debris and microbial mortality )."
LV2016011960,"The 3 other parameters ( rates of humus stabilisation and enzyme assimilation of labile and stable humus ) were found linked only to climate , suggesting that quality of humified materials should be more constant than OC forms from living materials."
LV2016011960,"In coupling with soil water and production modules , the model emerges as a new theoretical basis to describe the life cycle and its applications to agro-ecology and global change."
BG2019206854,"Currently , we are experiencing biodiversity loss on different spatial scales."
BG2019206854,One of the best studied taxonomic groups in decline is the butterflies.
BG2019206854,"Here , we review evidence for such declines using five systematic studies from southern Sweden that compare old butterfly surveys with the current situation."
BG2019206854,"Additionally , we provide data on butterfly and burnet moth extinctions in the regionâ € ™ s counties."
BG2019206854,"In some local areas , half of the butterfly fauna has been lost during the last 60 - 100 years."
BG2019206854,"In terms of extinctions , counties have lost 2 - 10 butterfly and burnet moth species."
BG2019206854,Land use has changed markedly with key butterfly habitats such as hay meadows disappearing at alarming rates.
BG2019206854,"Grazed , mixed open woodlands have been transformed into dense coniferous forests and clear - cuts and domestic grazers have been relocated from woodlands to arable fields and semi-natural grasslands."
BG2019206854,Ley has increased rapidly and is used for bale silage repeatedly during the season.
BG2019206854,"Overall , the changed and intensified land use has markedly reduced the availability of nectar resources in the landscape."
BG2019206854,Species that decline in Sweden are strongly decreasing or already extinct in other parts of Europe.
BG2019206854,"Many typical grassland species that were numerous in former times have declined severely ; among those Hesperia comma , Lycaena virgaureae , Lycaena hippothoe , Argynnis adippe , and Polyommatus semiargus."
BG2019206854,"Also , species associated with open woodlands and wetlands such as , Colias palaeno , Boloria euphrosyne and the glade - inhabiting Leptidea sinapis have all decreased markedly."
BG2019206854,"Current management practise and EU Common Agricultural Policy rules favour intensive grazing on the remaining semi-natural grasslands , with strong negative effects on butterfly diversity."
BG2019206854,Abandoned grasslands are very common in less productive areas of southern Sweden and these habitats may soon become forests.
BG2019206854,"There is an urgent need for immediate action to preserve unfertilized , mown and lightly grazed grasslands."
BG2019206854,It is also crucial to encourage that management of abandoned grasslands resumes before it is too late.
BG2019206854,"In order to mitigate risks of further species loss and to work towards recovery of threatened butterfly populations using best known practises , we recommend twelve types of management measures favourable for many butterflies."
RS2016000047,"Experiments were conducted during 2011 - 2012 , at three localities in Serbia ( Valjevo , Nova VaroÅ ¡ and Nova Pazova )."
RS2016000047,"The seed of spelt wheat cultivar Nirvana was used , having been selected at the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops in Novi Sad."
RS2016000047,The objective of the research was to assess the effect of agro-ecological conditions on morphological and productive properties of spelt wheat grown on different types of soils.
RS2016000047,"The effect of the locality was significantly expressed in all tested morphological properties of spelt wheat ( plant height , number of spikelets , number of grains per spikelet ) , while meteorological conditions ( year ) affected spike length and grain mass per spike significantly."
RS2016000047,The average grain yield from all three localities was 3.20 t ha - 1.
RS2016000047,"A considerably higher yield was achieved on chernozem , locality Nova Pazova ( 3.89 t ha - 1 )."
RS2016000047,The comparison of the grain yields from Valjevo ( eutric cambisol ) and Nova VaroÅ ¡ ( grey forest soil ) did not show any significant differences.
RS2016000043,The effect of different agro-ecological conditions on morphoproductive properties of buckwheat cultivar Novosadska was investigated during 2011 - 2012 at three different localities.
RS2016000043,"The types of soil on which the experiments were conducted were as follows : the eutric cambisol - in Valjevo , the chernozem - in Nova Pazova and the grey forest soil in Nova VaroÅ ¡ [ Serbia ]."
RS2016000043,Agro-ecological conditions affected the growth and productivity of the buckwheat crops at all three localities.
RS2016000043,"The highest yields per unit area were obtained on the chernozem - type soil ( 1.65 t ha - 1 ) , while the average yields on the less fertile soils in the hilly and mountainous regions of Serbia were 1.31 t ha - 1 on the grey forest soil and 0.80 t ha - 1 on the eutric cambisol."
RS2016000043,"The results showed that buckwheat can be successfully grown on different soil types , since the experiments on all locations were carried out without fertilization , i.e. using the natural fertility of the soil."
CA2015100149,Alternative sources of plant nutrients have now become imperative especially for vegetable crop production in Nigeria because of the escalating costs of inorganic fertilizers with the attendant environmental and health problems associated with excessive use of these inputs on continuously cropped fields.
CA2015100149,"A two - year field experiment was conducted during the early planting seasons from March to June of 2011 and 2012 on the acidic coastal plain soils at Calabar , to evaluate the combined effects of four rates each ( 0,5,10 and 15 t / ha ) of poultry manure ( PM ) and goat manure ( GM ) on soil chemical properties and agronomic performance of sweet maize ( Zea mays L. saccharata Strut .)"
CA2015100149,Factorial combinations of the treatments were fitted into a randomized complete block design with three replications.
CA2015100149,"The application of the manures significantly ( P â ‰ ¤ 0.05 ) raised the soil pH , organic matter content , total N , available P and exchangeable K , Ca and Mg status of the soil."
CA2015100149,"Except for pH , total N , and available P contents , GM had superior responses for all other chemical properties than PM."
CA2015100149,"The 15 t / ha rate of both manures maximized sweet maize growth attributes , total dry matter ( TDM ) and grain yields and also hastened days to 50 % tasselling."
CA2015100149,"On average , the application of 5 , 10 and 15 t / ha PM rates , increased TDM by 8.5 , 35.1 and 53.9 % , whereas the corresponding values for GM were 15.6 , 27.8 and 33.2 % respectively compared with the unamended control plots."
CA2015100149,"The grain yield increases at 15 t / ha PM and GM were 11.2 , 59.8 and 126.9 % ; and 4.2 , 20.0 and 45.8 % respectively , above the 10 , 5 and 0 t / ha rates of both manures."
CA2015100149,The growth and yield attributes showed greater responses to PM than GM in terms of the values obtained.
CA2015100149,The co-application of PM at 15 t / ha and GM at 10 t / ha had the best effects on TDM and grain yield and is thus recommended for sweet maize production in this agro-ecology.
IR2016700012,Germination is the first and most important developmental stage of plants which is influenced by genetic and environmental factors.
IR2016700012,Hydrotime model describes the relationship between water potential ( Ïˆ ) and seed germination rate and percentage.
IR2016700012,"This model quantifies the rate of germination progression ( Î ¸ H ) , the stress tolerance of germination ( Ïˆb ( 50 ) ) and the uniformity of germination ( ÏƒÏˆb )."
IR2016700012,"This indicators can be used to show seed lots or varieties vigor and evaluation of dormancy in seed and some treatments effects ( e.g. priming , ABA or GA ) on seeds vigor."
IR2016700012,Hydrotime model is not well known amongst Iranian researchers.
IR2016700012,This study aims at introducing the application of hydrotime model in germination data analysis.
IR2016700012,"To achieve this , germination data of three plants ( sweet clover : Melilotus officinalis , rye : Secale cereael and wheat : Triticum aestivum ) in response to drought stress were used."
IR2016700012,"The Î ¸ H value quantifies the inherent rate of germination , which can vary among species and different physiological stages."
IR2016700012,The Ïˆb ( 50 ) value is an indication of theaverage stress tolerance of the population.
IR2016700012,A population with a high Ïˆb ( 50 ) value ( less negative ) will be inhibited germination at higher Ïˆ ( less stress ) than will a population with a lower Ïˆb ( 50 ) value.
IR2016700012,The value of Ïˆb ( 50 ) for a seed population can be shifted to higher or lower values by the induction and release of dormancy.The ÏƒÏˆb value is a quantitative estimate of the uniformity in germination in the population as greater ÏƒÏˆb means a wider variation between the first and last seeds to germinate.
IR2016700013,"Selenium is of micronutrients which beside its effective role on increment of endurance of plants such as rice against undesirable environmental effects , plays an important role in human health , due to its anti-oxidant and anti-cancer characteristics."
IR2016700013,"Thus , to evaluate the influence of selenium on diminishing the negative effect of salinity and low seed storage in germination of Shafagh rice cultivar ( CV."
IR2016700013,Shafagh ) a factorial experiment was carried out based on completely randomized factorial design ( CRFD ) with three replications at the Physiology Lab of Shahid Chamran University in 2012.
IR2016700013,"Testing factors included pretreatment of seeds with selenium in 0 and 16 mg / l , salinity in three levels including 0 , 6 , and 12 dS / m , and seed grain weight of 22 , 24 , and 26 gr."
IR2016700013,Results showed that salinity stress caused drastic and significant damage on measured properties of rice germination as much as 32 to 59 % in germination indices and 30 - 60 % in germination characteristics.
IR2016700013,"Priming with selenium rectified the salinity damage ( 1 - 23 % ) and low seed grain weight ( 32 - 47 % ) significantly , so that the germination rate in control treatment was classified in the same statistical group with selenium treatments and seed grain weight of 24 gr and also rice primed with selenium and salinity of 6 dS / m. Accordingly , salinity value and low seed weight had a drastic negative effect on all measured properties , but selenium pretreatment rectified the damages on germination through the increment of anti-oxidant enzymes."
QC2017600024,"In Roquefort - cheese region , a few farmersâ € ™ groups are increasing grazed resources in the ewe diet to reduce cost and to improve the efficiency of the farms."
QC2017600024,A project between researchers and dairy sheep farmers was developed to analyse innovative livestock farming systems and to understand how farming management integrates the agroecological principles.
QC2017600024,"Twenty - seven farmersâ € ™ interviews about practices , farming management , animalsâ € ™ performances and economic results were carried out and analysed."
QC2017600024,"Four types of farming management were described based on ( i ) the duration of milking period and the supplementation of the flock , ( ii ) the diversity of resources , ( iii ) the genetic gains use."
QC2017600024,The practices identified can be linked to the agroecological principles.
QC2017600024,"They are implemented by farmers to reach a compromise between three targets : productivity , self - sufficiency and economic efficiency."
QC2017600024,This study highlighted these practices as levers for action used by farmers to increase their farmâ € ™ s adaptability.
QC2017600024,Results could be used to design and to assess new farming systems.
FR2016200841,Mixed cropâ € “ livestock ( MCâ € “ L ) farming has gained broad consensus as an economically and environmentally sustainable farming system.
FR2016200841,"Working on a Charolais - area suckler cattle farms network , we subdivided the 66 farms of a constant sample , for 2 years ( 2010 and 2011 ) , into four groups : ( i ) â € ˜specialized conventional livestock farmsâ € ™ ( 100 % grassland - based farms ( GF ) , n = 7 ) ; ( ii ) â € ˜integrated conventional cropâ € “ livestock farmsâ € ™ ( specialized farms that only market animal products but that grow cereal crops on - farm for animal feed , n = 31 ) ; ( iii ) â € ˜mixed conventional cropâ € “ livestock farmsâ € ™ ( farms that sell beef and cereal crops to market , n = 21 ) ; and ( iv ) organic farms ( n = 7 )."
FR2016200841,"We analyse the differences in structure and in drivers of technical , economic and environmental performances."
FR2016200841,The figures for all the farms over 2 years ( 2010 and 2011 ) were pooled into a single sample for each group.
FR2016200841,The farms that sell crops alongside beef miss out on potential economies of scale.
FR2016200841,These farms are bigger than specialized beef farms ( with or without on - farm feed crops ) and all types of farms show comparable economic performances.
FR2016200841,The big MCâ € “ L farms make heavier and consequently less efficient use of inputs.
FR2016200841,This use of less efficient inputs also weakens their environmental performances.
FR2016200841,This subpopulation of suckler cattle farms appears unable to translate a MCâ € “ L strategy into economies of scope.
FR2016200841,"Organic farms most efficiently exploit the diversity of herd feed resources , thus positioning organic agriculture as a prototype MCâ € “ L system meeting the core principles of agroecology."
FR2016229131,We need to break away from intensive agriculture based on non-renewable and toxic inputs.
FR2016229131,Safer practices are indeed emerging.
FR2016229131,Sustainable agriculture started about 50 years ago with the design of integrated pest management ( IPM ) to counteract pesticide misuse and abuse.
FR2016229131,Ecological intensification emerged only a few years ago.
FR2016229131,"Here we review the literature to compare ecological intensification and IPM , from the point of view of crop protection."
FR2016229131,We present also agroecology and organic farming.
FR2016229131,"Neither ecological intensification nor IPM have philosophical bases such as agroecology , or to an even larger extent , biodynamic agriculture."
FR2016229131,"Ecological intensification , IPM and agroecology are polysemous , flexible and pragmatic approaches , whereas organic farming is well - defined by its scope and standards."
FR2016229131,"Ecological intensification , in explicitly pursuing the goal of increasing food production to feed the planet , differs from agroecology , whose proponents think that the view that world hunger will be solved by merely increasing yield is an oversimplification."
FR2016229131,"In terms of cropping system design , in its actual practice , IPM often remains based on methods that increase the efficiency of chemical pesticide use."
FR2016229131,"Or , along with organic agriculture , it may remain based on substitution of pesticides by less harmful alternatives."
FR2016229131,"In contrast , ecologically intensive crop protection usually requires cropping system redesign."
FR2016229131,"In terms of ecosystem service provision , IPM tends to focus on the pest - pathogen regulation service."
FR2016229131,"In contrast , both ecological intensification and agroecology pay attention to both practices which were designed for crop protection and biomass provision purposes , as well as practices with broader scope , primarily designed to offer other ecosystem services which are found to have indirect effects on crop protection."
FR2016229131,"This chapter also describes selected tropical case studies of crop protection , such as upland rice seed - dressing and fruit fly control in orchards , to compare and contrast crop protection in these contexts."
FR2016229131,"Finally , we propose to consider IPM and ecologically intensive crop protection as complementary rather than conflicting approaches."
FR2016229131,The concept of â € œultimate IPMâ € brings IPM closer to ecologically intensive crop protection.
FR2016229131,"This new approach involves starting from a nearly natural ecosystem to which inputs are gradually added when absolutely necessary , rather than starting from a conventional agroecosystem and gradually remove inputs from it."
LV2016010227,Agriculture faces the challenge of increasing food production while simultaneously reducing the use of inputs and delivering other ecosystem services.
LV2016010227,"Ecological intensification of agriculture is a paradigm shift , which has recently been proposed to meet such challenges through the manipulation of biotic interactions."
LV2016010227,"While this approach opens up new possibilities , there are many constraints related to the complexity of agroecosystems that make it difficult to implement."
LV2016010227,"Future advances , which are essential to guide agricultural policy , require an eco-evolutionary framework to ensure that ecological intensification is beneficial in the long term."
FR2014009392,Environmental models often involve complex dynamic and spatial inputs and outputs.
FR2014009392,This raises specific issues when performing uncertainty and sensitivity analyses ( SA ).
FR2014009392,"Based on appli - cations in flood risk assessment and agro-ecology , we present current research to adapt the methods of variance - based SA to such models."
FR2014009392,"After recalling the basic principles , we propose a metamodelling approach of dynamic models based on a reduced - basis approximation of PDEs and we show how the error on the subsequent sensitivity indices can be quantified."
FR2014009392,We then present a mix of pragmatic and methodological solutions to perform the SA of a dynamic agro-climatic model with non standard input factors.
FR2014009392,SA is then applied to a flood risk model with spatially distributed inputs and outputs.
FR2014009392,Block sensitivity indices are defined and a precise relationship between these indices and their support size is established.
FR2014009392,"Finally , we show how the whole support landscape and its key features can be incorporated in the SA of a spatial model."
AL2015102640,"Five watermelon varieties , Sugar Baby , Charleston Grey , Kaolak , Crimson Sweet and Oranaise and three cucumber varieties , Poinsett , Ashley and Royal hybrid were grown on the field in two trials ( i ) late season between August and October 2008 and ( ii ) early season between April and June 2012 in Abeokuta , Ogun State to evaluate the cultivars for virus symptoms and viruses under natural tropical conditions."
AL2015102640,"Symptomatic leaf samples were collected from each crop variety and indexed for Cucumber mosaic virus ( CMV ) , Melon necrotic spot virus ( MNSV ) , Papaya ringspot virus ( PRSV ) , Watermelon mosaic virus ( WMV ) , Zucchini yellow mosaic virus ( ZYMV ) and Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus ( CGMMV ) in Double Antibody Sandwich ( DAS ) Enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA )."
AL2015102640,The disease incidence was 100.0 % at 6 weeks after planting ( WAP ) for all the cucurbits crops for both seasons while the highest symptom severity score at 10 WAP was 4 and 5 for watermelon and 3.6 and 4 for cucumber in the 1st and 2nd trials.
AL2015102640,"The viruses detected in late season were CMV , CGMMV and MNSV which occurred in all the cucumber and watermelon varieties."
AL2015102640,"In addition PRSV , WMV and ZYMV occurred in mixed infection in the cucumber varieties Pointsett and Royal Hybrid."
AL2015102640,"In the early season , PRSV was the most prevalent virus infection in the cucumber and watermelon varieties."
AL2015102640,"Also CMV+PRSV , PRSV+WMV , and MNSV+PRSV occurred in mixed infection in Charleston Grey , Oranaise and Sugar Baby respectively."
AL2015102640,The viruses detected are among the viruses reported to limit the production of cucurbit crops world - wide.
FR2017103997,Chemical control has highly expanded over the last 30 years in sub-Saharan Africa to reduce bio-aggressors on all crops.
FR2017103997,Pest management of fruits and vegetables by small farmers in sub-Saharan Africa have developed anarchically in a fuzzy regulation framework.
FR2017103997,Pesticide toxicity and excessive application are often criticized both by farmers and consumers.
FR2017103997,"Here , we review pesticide management in sub-Saharan Africa over the past 30 years."
FR2017103997,"We then propose options to improve and reduce pesticide application , in order to decrease environmental and human hazards."
FR2017103997,The major points are as follows : ( 1 ) global changes in sub-Saharan Africa such as urbanization modify farmer practices and crop losses.
FR2017103997,( 2 ) Pesticides are more and more used by small farmers in an unsustainable way.
FR2017103997,( 3 ) The risk of pesticide application for human health and environment is poorly known.
FR2017103997,( 4 ) We propose options to reduce pesticide application based upon integrated pest management ( IPM ) and agroecology.
FR2017103997,"Moreover , IPM increases farmer economy , thus decreasing poverty."

NG2019200828,There is difficulty in identifying this female telfairia at seed and seedling stages.
NG2019200828,This research identified effect of seed position and fruit origin on the vigor performance and sex ratio of Telfairia occidentalis.
NG2019200828,"Three seed positions of anterior , middle and posterior sections of fruits sourced from four origins of growth were studied in the nursery and field plots at the teaching and research farm of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology , Ogbomoso , Nigeria."
NG2019200828,Vigor index and percentage emergence were highest for seedlings from the anterior portions with fruits sourced from Imo and Ibadan origins.
NG2019200828,"Genotypic Coefficient of Variation ( GCV ) and Heritability estimate in the broad sense ( HB ) for branching , foliage , vine length and diameter traits were also high for plants developed from anterior seed positions and therefore can be reliably selected."
NG2019200828,More female plants were sighted to have developed from the anterior positions with 3:1 and 2:1 female to male proportions for fruits sourced from Imo and Ogbomoso origins.
NG2019200828,There were difficulties in obtaining exact genetic sex ratios.
NG2019200828,This is attributed to differences in flowering time in the male and female plants.
NG2019200828,"Fruits sourced from humid environment of Imo state and seeds extracted from anterior position , recorded highest seedling vigor performance and high female to male proportions for the field established plants."

FR2017103430,We need to break away from intensive agriculture based on non-renewable and toxic inputs.
FR2017103430,Safer practices are indeed emerging.
FR2017103430,Sustainable agriculture started about 50 years ago with the design of integrated pest management ( IPM ) to counteract pesticide misuse and abuse.
FR2017103430,Ecological intensification emerged only a few years ago.
FR2017103430,"Here we review the literature to compare ecological intensification and IPM , from the point of view of crop protection."
FR2017103430,We present also agroecology and organic farming.
FR2017103430,"Neither ecological intensification nor IPM have philosophical bases such as agroecology , or to an even larger extent , biodynamic agriculture."
FR2017103430,"Ecological intensification , IPM and agroecology are polysemous , flexible and pragmatic approaches , whereas organic farming is well - defined by its scope and standards."
FR2017103430,"E cological intensification , in explicitly pursuing the goal of increasing food production to feed the planet , differs from agroecology , whose proponents think that the view that world hunger will be solved by merely increasing yield is an oversimplification."
FR2017103430,"In terms of cropping system design , in its actual practice , IPM often remains based on methods that increase the efficiency of chemical pesticide use."
FR2017103430,"Or , along with organic agriculture , it may remain based on substitution of pesticides by less harmful alternatives."
FR2017103430,"In contrast , ecologically intensive crop protection usually requires cropping system redesign."
FR2017103430,"In terms of ecosystem service provision , IPM tends to focus on the pest - pathogen regulation service."
FR2017103430,"In contrast , both ecological intensification and agroecology pay attention to both practices which were designed for crop protection and biomass provision purposes , as well as practices with broader scope , primarily designed to offer other ecosystem services which are found to have indirect effects on crop protection."

QC2017600026,"To achieve the sustainability goals of future agriculture , agroecology was often mentioned and dis - cussed in the last decade."
QC2017600026,"Surprisingly , the very large majority of publications on agroecology are related to cropping systems and different issues of plant production , whereas only rare publications are related so far to livestock systems and animal production."
QC2017600026,In this paper we analyse this relation between agroecology and herbivore farming systems by defining six groups of principles and seven categories of agroecological prac - tices.
QC2017600026,"The principles we propose for agroecological herbivore farming systems can be classified into ( i ) knowl - edge , culture and socio - economics , ( ii ) biodiversity conservation and management , ( iii ) resource manage - ment , ( iv ) system management , ( v ) food and health , and ( vi ) social relations."
QC2017600026,"The agroecological practices which could or should be implemented to establish sustainable herbivore farming systems can be grouped in to ( i ) diversification of land use , land cover and productions , ( ii ) resource management in mixed crop - live - stock systems , ( iii ) biodiversity conservation , ( iv ) grassland management , ( v ) livestock management , ( vi ) food and food system , ( vii ) diversification of income sources."
QC2017600026,These underlying groups of principles and categories of practices should be considered for the development of sustainable agricultural herbivore farming systems.

FR2014007349,"Although a range of recent PST invasions at continental scales are well documented , the worldwide population structure and the center of origin of the pathogen were still unknown."
FR2014007349,"In this study , we used multilocus microsatellite genotyping to infer worldwide population structure of PST and the origin of new invasions based on 409 isolates representative of distribution of the fungus on six continents."
FR2014007349,Bayesian and multivariate clustering methods partitioned the set of multilocus genotypes into six distinct genetic groups associated with their geographical origin.
FR2014007349,"Analyses of linkage disequilibrium and genotypic diversity indicated a strong regional heterogeneity in levels of recombination , with clear signatures of recombination in the Himalayan ( Nepal and Pakistan ) and near - Himalayan regions ( China ) and a predominant clonal population structure in other regions."
FR2014007349,"The higher genotypic diversity , recombinant population structure and high sexual reproduction ability in the Himalayan and neighboring regions suggests this area as the putative center of origin of PST."
FR2014007349,We used clustering methods and approximate Bayesian computation ( ABC ) to compare different competing scenarios describing ancestral relationship among ancestral populations and more recently founded populations.
FR2014007349,"Our analyses confirmed the Middle East - East Africa as the most likely source of newly spreading , high - temperature - adapted strains ; Europe as the source of South American , North American and Australian populations ; and Mediterranean - Central Asian populations as the origin of South African populations."

FR2014010352,"The first hypothesis posits that the emergence of commercial food farming depends on complementarities between different cropping systems , including agroforestry gardens."
FR2014010352,"This type of agriculture , however , is characterized by a fragmented and diversified food supply structure , which presents limitations for the supply of urban markets."

FR2016228418,"It emphasizes practitionersâ € ™ needs for information and research to reinforce these innovations , and makes recommendations on the public policies needed to promote them."
FR2016228418,The report highlights how market incentives can promote the development of innovative initiatives that strengthen food sovereignty while linking small producers to markets.
FR2016228418,"It also recognizes the role of the promoters of these initiatives as social mediators who bring together scientific and traditional knowledge and mobilize other actors , promoting sustainable innovations."
FR2016228418,"Finally , the document proposes various public policies for strengthening innovative initiatives , such as the creation of legislation and a legal framework to support agro-ecology and sustainable agriculture , and the recognition of local and indigenous knowledge and its integration into scientific knowledge through a formal framework for education and dissemination."
FR2016218451,Climate change is forecasted to induce more drought stress events.
FR2016218451,Water scarcity is already the most limiting abiotic stress for crop production.
FR2016218451,"With higher food demand , there is a need for sustainable solutions to cope with the loss of productivity due to water stress."
FR2016218451,It is known that plant growth - promoting rhizobacteria ( PGPR ) can colonize plant roots and increase plant growth.
FR2016218451,"However , there is actually no sustainable method to decrease the impact of water stress."
FR2016218451,"Therefore , we hypothesized that an application of thuricin - 17 , a molecule produced by the PGPR Bacillus thuringiensis , could enhance soybean tolerance to water stress."
FR2016218451,"We grew soybean plants for 1 month in growth chambers in order to evaluate their response to thuricin - 17 root application under drought , in association with the inoculation of N2 - fixing Bradyrhizobium japonicum."
FR2016218451,"We measured traits reflecting root architecture : number of tips , root diameter , root length , number of nodules ; water fluxes : water potential , stomatal conductance ; carbon nutrition : leaf area , photosynthetic rate , biomass and carbon partitioning ; nitrogen nutrition : nitrogen partitioning and hormone signalling : abscisic acid concentration during the vegetative growth period."
FR2016218451,"Our results show that thuricin - 17 application under water stress increased plant biomass by 17 % , thus masking drought impact."
FR2016218451,"This effect is due to modifications of below - ground structures , with 37 % increase of root and 55 % increase of nodule biomass , and to slight increases of leaf area and photosynthetic rate.We also observed that application of thuricin - 17 induced a 30 % increase of root abscisic acid , an increase of root length and of leaf water potential."
FR2016218451,"Finally , thuricin - 17 induced an activation of nodule formation by 40 % , a partial restoration of nodule - specific activity , nodule growth and consequently , an increase by 17 % of the total nitrogen amount in the plant.Overall , our findings reveal a new method to decrease the negative impact of water stress."
FR2016218451,Results also demonstrate that the plant restored an adequate water and N balance by changing its rootstructure
FR2016218278,"Agriculture is the main source of terrestrial emissions of N2O , a potent greenhouse gas and the main cause of ozone layer depletion."
FR2016218278,The reduction of N2O into N - 2 by microorganisms carrying the nitrous oxide reductase gene ( nosZ ) is the only biological process known to eliminate this greenhouse gas.
FR2016218278,"Recent studies showed that a previously unknown clade of N2O - reducers was related to the capacity of the soil to act as an N2O sink , opening the way for new strategies to mitigate emissions."
FR2016218278,"Here , we investigated whether the agricultural practices could differently influence the two N2O reducer clades with consequences for denitrification end - products."
FR2016218278,"The abundance of N2O - reducers and producers was quantified by real - time PCR , and the diversity of both nosZ clades was determined by 454 pyrosequencing."
FR2016218278,Potential N2O production and potential denitrification activity were used to calculate the denitrification gaseous end - product ratio.
FR2016218278,"Overall , the results showed limited differences between management practices but there were significant differences between cropping systems in both the abundance and structure of the nosZII community , as well as in the [ rN ( 2 ) O / r ( N2O + N - 2 ) ] ratio."
FR2016218278,"More limited differences were observed in the nosZI community , suggesting that the newly identified nosZII clade is more sensitive than nosZI to environmental changes."
FR2016218278,"Potential denitrification activity and potential N2O production were explained mainly by the soil properties while the diversity of the nosZII clade on its own explained 26 % of the denitrification end - product ratio , which highlights the importance of understanding the ecology of this newly identified clade of N2O reducers for mitigation strategies."
ES2015104915,"This paper reflect an overview of the effect that the farming practices are producing over the climate change , but separating the negative consequences of the intensive manage systems of the positive effects of the traditional livestock production linked to the local zoogenetic resources and the Agroecology."
ES2015104915,Finally a description is done of the economic crisis effect over the use of local breeds in the control of the climatic changes.
LV2016016490,"Several species of the predatory mite family Phytoseiidae are of major economic importance for biological pest control in crops , including grapevines."
LV2016016490,Plant diversification in agrosystems is reported to enhance useful biodiversity and provide ecosystem services.
LV2016016490,"Thus , agroforestry , which consists in co-planting trees and crops , is assumed to be a possible way to ensure regulation of pest outbreaks by phytoseiid mites."
LV2016016490,This paper investigates the effect of trees ( Pinus pinea and Sorbus domestica ) within vineyards on Phytoseiidae communities.
LV2016016490,"Five experimental plots were considered , two where vines were co-planted with P. pinea and S. domestica , and three monoculture plots : vines , P. pinea and S. domestica."
LV2016016490,"Sampling was carried out on vines and trees in 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2010 and 2012."
LV2016016490,A higher Phytoseiidae diversity was observed in agroforestry plots than in monoculture plots.
LV2016016490,"Kampimodromus aberrans ( replacing T. [ T. ] exhilaratus ) seemed to colonize these plots 15 years after its plantation , especially when vines were co-planted with P. pinea."
LV2016016490,Factors affecting these faunistical changes are discussed.
LV2016016490,Effects on Phytoseiidae densities differed depending on grape cultivartree species associations.
LV2016016490,Factors affecting these interactions are discussed ; plant diversity does not simply lead to a higher density and diversity of natural enemies.
LV2016015216,"groecology is today a source of numerous publications defining the term as a science , a movement or a set of practices ( Wezel et al. , 2009 , 2014 )."
LV2016015216,"Indeed , agroecology involves various approaches."
LV2016015216,Following political and scientific commitments the French National Institute for Agricultural Research ( INRA ) ranked agroecology among its top two research priorities for the 2010â € “ 2020 period.
LV2016015216,"To develop ambitious and large - scale experiments on an experimental research unit , the Joint Research Unit ( JRU ) â € ˜Agroecologieâ € ™ ( Dijon , eastern France ) , associated with the Experimental Research Unit Dijon - Epoisses ( 20 km next to Dijon ) , has laid the foundations for a future experimental site."
LV2016015216,This will focus on work that links across various scales ( from the organisms interactions to the landscape scale ) and will welcome research on a range of topics ( among those of the Joint Research Unit â € ˜Agroecologieâ € ™ and the experimental research Unit Dijon - Epoisses ).
LV2016015216,"With its 130 ha divided into 70 fields , all drained and irrigable , the Unit Dijon - Epoisses carries out research at field scale in agronomy , ecology , genetic and agroecology."
LV2016015216,"Currently , the current two major challenges of the experimental unit are to improve crop varieties of various crops to meet the future needs of farmers and to evaluate innovative cropping systems with low inputs , promoting integrated pest management."
LV2016015216,"Indeed , the historic mission of the Unit was to support work on crop selection with a high number of experimental micro-field plots."
LV2016015216,"For 35 years , the experimental unit has studied legumes , cereals , and forage crops."
LV2016015216,"The diversity of crop species on site is still high : wheat , barley , oat , corn , faba bean , lupin , oilseed rape , sugar beet , mustard etc.."
LV2016015216,"The second main task of the unit is to develop , evaluate and design innovative cropping systems less reliant on pesticides."
LV2016015216,It thus responds to the major current issues related to food security and environmental protection.
LV2016015216,"Since 2000 , on the Unit ( Fig. 1 ) , the JRU â € ˜Agroecologieâ € ™ has carried out a long - term cropping system experiment testing five innovative weed management systems ( Chikowo et al. , 2009 ; Cordeau et al. , 2014 )."
LV2016015216,"In addition , since 2012 , the RÃ © s0pest project has tested pesticide - free cropping systems across a network of eight sites in France among Dijon - Epoisses.The Dijon - Epoisses experimental site ( Fig. 1 ) is surrounded by important physical elements including the highway , the Burgundy canal and a railway line."
LV2016015216,"There are some landscape elements , 6 ha of woods , many grassy ditches , many sown grass margin strips ( 5 m wide , 2.46 ha ) , 5 field margin flower strips ( 0.15 ha ) , grass paths ( 1.47 ha ) and a young hedge ( 260 m , 0.11 ha ) established in 2012."
LV2016015216,"In Dijon , a working group composed of 40 agronomists , weed scientists , plant and microbial ecologists , pathologists , ecophysiologists , geneticists and field experimenters are currently working to select and link their research topics in the design of the site."
LV2016015216,"The questions are likely 272to deal with the trade - offs between ecosystem function / services ( e.g. design and evaluation of cropping systems maintaining agricultural production in terms of food quality and quantity with environmental - friendly practices ) , the underlying processes occurring in fields in agroecological systems ( plant - microbe interactions , effects of above - and belowground organisms on plant diversity and ecosystem processes , genotype / environment interactions , biological regulations of pest and disease , weed management with biological regulation and biocontrol ) , etc.."
LV2016015216,The research tool provided by the site will allow prospective and innovative approaches to be combined.
LV2016015216,"It will contain , juxtaposed or nested , analytical ( factorial design ) , cropping system ( systemic design ) , and landscape experiments ( Fig. 2 )."
LV2016015216,"The juxtaposition of experiments may be used to study targeted processes at the intra-field scale ( e.g. plant - plant , plant - microbe , plant - pest relationships ) in different surrounding landscape contexts ( e.g. with or without semi-natural habitats )."
LV2016015216,"The nested experiments can be used to study the intra-field processes occurring within various cropping systems , e.g. conventional tillage vs no - till systems and also be used to study the effect of the same cropping systems in various surrounding landscapes ( e.g. with or without semi-natural habitats )."
TR2016007621,"The eddy covariance ( EC ) technique as a powerful statistics - based method of measurement and calculation the vertical turbulent fluxes of greenhouses gases within atmospheric boundary layers provides the continuous , long - term flux information integrated at the ecosystem scale."
TR2016007621,An attractive way to compare the agricultural practices influences on GHG fluxes is to divide a crop area into subplots managed in different ways.
TR2016007621,"The research has been carried out in the Precision Farming Experimental Field of the Russian Timiryazev State Agricultural University ( RTSAU , Moscow ) in 2013 under the support of RF Government grant # 11."
TR2016007621,"G34 .31.0079 , EU grant # 603542 LUÐ ¡ 4Ð ¡ ( 7FP ) and RF Ministry of education and science grant # 14 -120-14-4266-ScSh."
TR2016007621,"Arable Umbric Albeluvisols have around 1 % of SOC , 5.4 pH ( KCl ) and NPK medium - enhanced contents in sandy loam topsoil."
TR2016007621,The CO2 flux seasonal monitoring has been done by two eddy covariance stations located at the distance of 108 m.
TR2016007621,The LI - COR instrumental equipment was the same for the both stations.
TR2016007621,The stations differ only by current crop version : barley or vetch and oats.
TR2016007621,"At both sites , diurnal patterns of NEE among different months were very similar in shape but varied slightly in amplitude."
TR2016007621,NEE values were about zero during spring time.
TR2016007621,"CO2 fluxes have been intensified after crop emerging from values of 3 to 7 Âµmol / sâˆ ™ m2 for emission , and from 5 to 20 Âµmol / sâˆ ™ m2 for sink."
TR2016007621,Stabilization of the fluxes has come at achieving plants height of 10 - 12 cm.
TR2016007621,Average NEE was negative only in June and July.
TR2016007621,Maximum uptake was observed in June with average values about 8 Âµmol CO2 mâˆ ’ 2 sâˆ ’ 1.
TR2016007621,"Although different kind of crops were planted on the fields A and B , GPP dynamics was quite similar for both sites : after reaching the peak values at the mid of June , GPP decreased from 4 to 0.5 g C CO2 m - 2 d - 1 at the end of July."
TR2016007621,The difference in crops harvesting time that was equal two weeks did not significantly influence the daily GPP patterns.
TR2016007621,Cumulative assimilation of CO2 at the end of the growing season was about 150 g C mâˆ ’ 2 for both sites.
TR2016007621,So the difference in NEE was the consequence of essentially higher respiration rates in case of vetch and oats ( about 350 g C mâˆ ’ 2 ) comparing to barley ( 250 g C mâˆ ’ 2 ) that needs additional research.
TR2016007621,"The results have shown high daily and seasonal dynamic of CO2 emission too as a result of different and contrasted conditions : crop type , crop development stage , soil moisture and air temperature."
TR2016007621,"Obtained unique for Russian agriculture data are useful for land - use practices environmental assessment , for soil organic carbon dynamics analysis and agroecological evaluation."
CN2016301168,The meat industry can not respond to increases in demand by ever increasing resource use.
CN2016301168,"The industry must find solutions to issues regarding animal welfare , health and sustainability and will have to do so in the face of competition from emerging non-traditional meat and protein products in an increasingly complex regulatory environment."
CN2016301168,"These novel meat and protein products , otherwise known as â € ˜artificial meatâ € ™ are utilising ground breaking technologies designed to meet the issues facing the conventional meat industry."
CN2016301168,"These artificial meats , in vitro or cultured meat and meat from genetically modified organisms have no real capacity to compete with conventional meat production in the present environment."
CN2016301168,"However , meat replacements manufactured from plant proteins and mycoproteins are currently the biggest competitors and are gaining a small percentage of the market."
CN2016301168,"Manufactured meats may push conventional meat into the premium end of the market , and supply the bulk , cheap end of the market if conventional meat products become more expensive and the palatability and versatility of manufactured meats improve."
CN2016301168,In time the technology for other artificial meats such as meat from genetic modified organisms or cultured meat may become sufficiently developed for these products to enter the market with no complexity of the competition between meat products.
CN2016301168,Conventional meat producers can assimilate agroecology ecology concepts in order to develop sustainable animal production systems.
CN2016301168,"The conventional meat industry can also benefit from assimilating biotechnologies such as cloning and genetic modification technologies , using the technology to adapt to the changing environment and respond to the increasing competition from artificial meats."
CN2016301168,"Although it will depend at least partly on the evolution of conventional meat production , the future of artificial meat produced from stem cells appears uncertain at this time."
FR2016219186,"In European grassland landscapes , grazing and mowing play a key role for the maintenance of high - quality habitats that host important bird populations."
FR2016219186,"As grasslands are also key resources for cattle feeding , there is a need to develop management strategies that achieve the double objective of production and biodiversity conservation."
FR2016219186,"The objective of this study was to use a modelling approach to generate recognisable patterns of bird dynamics in farms composed of different land use proportions , and to compare their production and ecological dimensions."
FR2016219186,"We developed a dynamic model , which linked grassland management to bird population dynamics at the field and farm levels."
FR2016219186,The model was parameterised for two types of suckling farms corresponding to contrasting levels of grassland intensification and for two bird species of high conservation value.
FR2016219186,A viability algorithm was used to define and assess viable management strategies for production and ecological performance so as to draw the shape of the relationship between both types of performances for the two types of farms.
FR2016219186,"Our results indicated that , at the farm level , there was a farming system effect with a negative and non-linear relationship linking performance."
FR2016219186,Improving bird population maintenance was less costly in extensive farms compared with intensive farms.
FR2016219186,"At the field level , the model predicted the timing and intensity of land use , maximising either production or ecological performance."
FR2016219186,"The results suggested that multi-objective grassland management would benefit from public policies that consider levels of organisation higher than the field level , such as the farm or the landscape."
US2016B00163,Common bacterial blight ( CBB ) caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv.
US2016B00163,phaseoli is the most important biotic production constraint to common bean in eastern Ethiopia.
US2016B00163,Climate change could have an impact on the disease epidemiology by influencing both common bean growth and the pathogen reproduction.
US2016B00163,The effects of climate change needs to be mitigated using climate change resilience strategies.
US2016B00163,Field experiments were conducted in the 2012 and 2013 cropping seasons at Haramaya and Babile research stations in eastern Ethiopia to assess the effects of integrating climate change resilience strategies on CBB of common bean.
US2016B00163,Gofta ( G2816 ) and Mexican 142 ( 11239 ) common bean varieties were used.
US2016B00163,"Eight climate change resilience strategies used were compost application , row intercropping and furrow planting alone and in combination."
US2016B00163,Factorial combinations of two common bean varieties and eight climate change resilience strategies totally 16 treatment combinations were studied in randomized complete block design ( RCBD ) with three replications and repeated once.
US2016B00163,Disease severity data were recorded from 10 randomly tagged plants from four central rows per plot.
US2016B00163,"Disease severity , area under disease progress curve ( AUDPC ) and disease progress rate were significantly different among climate change resilience strategies , between varieties , cropping seasons and locations."
US2016B00163,"Disease severities , AUDPC and disease progress rate were consistently less on row intercropping + compost application + furrow planting and row intercropping + compost application compared to singly applied climate change resilience strategies and sole planting plots in both locations and seasons."
US2016B00163,The disease epidemic was relatively higher on Mexican 142 than Gofta and during 2012 than 2013 at Babile than Haramaya.
US2016B00163,Integrated climate resilience strategies reduced CBB epidemics and could be applied as a component in management of CBB in eastern Ethiopia and in areas with similar agro-ecological zones.
FR2017101692,"A comparative analysis of agroecology network led to a classification based on their conditions of emergence , their structure and governance mechanisms."
FR2017101692,The study points the strengths and weaknesses of the existing networks at the different scales.
FR2017101692,"It shows that the different agroecology schools are not necessarily well coordinated at each level ( national , regional , global ) nor across levels for each agroecology school."
FR2017101692,The activities of a regional agroecology learning alliance should be grounded in strong national networks and endorsed by global networks.
FR2017102947,"Starting from the early 1990s , a multitude of national and regional initiatives have emerged in the Great Mekong Sub-Region for supporting ecological intensification of agriculture or agroecology."
FR2017102947,"The French Agency for Development ( AFD ) has been a very active supporter of these initiatives , especially in relation to the promotion of Conservation Agriculture and the establishment of the Conservation Agriculture Network for South East Asia ( CANSEA )."
FR2017102947,"In addition to its initial focus on Conservation Agriculture and with the objective of widening the scope of agroecology by including all other â € œschoolsâ € such as Organic Agriculture , Agroforestry , Integrated Pest Management , System of Rice Intensificationâ € ¦ , the AFD commissioned a study to better understand regional and national agroecology dynamics and initiatives , their strengths and weaknesses as well as the main issues at stake for their large scale dissemination."
FR2017102947,"The authors conducted this study in 2013 in the six countries of the GMS , through a review of the literature combined with country based consultation workshops in Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar and Vietnam and expert surveys in Thailand and Yunnan - China."
FR2017102947,"This publication aims at sharing some of the study 's key findings , and at providing a broad , yet non-exhaustive , overview of the current situation of agroecology in the Great Mekong Region."
FR2016205484,"Even though recent studies have clarified the influence and hierarchy of environmental filters on bacterial community structure , those constraining bacterial populations variations remain unclear."
FR2016205484,"In consequence , our ability to understand to ecological attributes of soil bacteria and to predict microbial community response to environmental stress is therefore limited."
FR2016205484,"Here , we characterized the bacterial community composition and the various bacterial taxonomic groups constituting the community across an agricultural landscape of 12 km ( 2 ) , by using a 215x215m systematic grid representing 278 sites to precisely decipher their spatial distribution and drivers at this scale."
FR2016205484,The bacterial and Archaeal community composition was characterized by applying 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing directly to soil DNA from samples.
FR2016205484,Geostatistics tools were used to reveal the heterogeneous distribution of bacterial composition at this scale.
FR2016205484,"Soil physical parameters and land management explained a significant amount of variation , suggesting that environmental selection is the major process shaping bacterial composition."
FR2016205484,All taxa systematically displayed also a heterogeneous and particular distribution patterns.
FR2016205484,"Different relative influences of soil characteristics , land use and space were observed , depending on the taxa , implying that selection and spatial processes might be differentially but not exclusively involved for each bacterial phylum."
FR2016205484,Soil pH was a major factor determining the distribution of most of the bacterial taxa and especially the most important factor explaining the spatial patterns of - Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes.
FR2016205484,"Soil texture , organic carbon content and quality were more specific to a few number of taxa ( e.g. , - Proteobacteria and Chlorobi )."
FR2016205484,"Land management also influenced the distribution of bacterial taxa across the landscape and revealed different type of response to cropping intensity ( positive , negative , neutral or hump - backed relationships ) according to phyla."
FR2016205484,"Altogether , this study provided valuable clues about the ecological behavior of soil bacterial and archaeal taxa at an agricultural landscape scale and could be useful for developing sustainable strategies of land management."
XF2016006344,"FAO held , with the support of France , the Swiss Development Cooperation and the Foreign Office of Agriculture of Switzerland , the International Symposium on Agroecology for Food Security and Nutrition at its headquarters in Rome on 18 and 19 September 2014 and a side - event on the Symposium during COAG on 30 September 2014."
XF2016006344,The Symposium was of a scientific and technical nature with a High Level Segment in the afternoon of the second day.
XF2016006344,"Overall the Symposium can be considered a very successful event , during which FAO took the responsibility of providing a neutral forum for discussion."
XF2016006344,This report provides an overview of the Symposium and the COAG side - event.
XF2016004000,The book begins with a focus on the key ecological factors and resources that impact agricultural plants and animals as individual organisms.
XF2016004000,"It then examines all of the components of agroecosystem complexity , from genetics to landscapes and explores the transition process for achieving sustainability and indicators of progress."
XF2016004000,"The book then delves into power and control of food systems by agribusiness , and the need to develop a new paradigm that moves beyond production and explores issues of food justice , equity , food security and sovereignty."
XF2016004000,"The book concludes with a call to action so that research and education can link together for transformative change in our food systems.Groundbreaking in its first edition , respected in its second edition , this third edition of this standard textbook has evolved along with the field."
XF2016004000,"Written by an expert with more than 40 years of experience , the third edition begins with a strong ecological foundation for farming practices and ends with all of us thinking about the critical importance of transitioning to a new paradigm for food and agriculture , and what this means for our future."
FR2016203848,"Intensive agriculture has led to several drawbacks such as biodiversity loss , climate change , erosion , and pollution of air and water."
FR2016203848,A potential solution is to implement management practices that increase the level of provision of ecosystem services such as soil fertility and biological regulation.
FR2016203848,There is a lot of literature on the principles of agroecology.
FR2016203848,"However , there is a gap of knowledge between agroecological principles and practical applications."
FR2016203848,"Therefore , we review here agroecological and management sciences to identify two facts that explain the lack of practical applications : ( 1 ) the occurrence of high uncertainties about relations between agricultural practices , ecological processes , and ecosystem services , and ( 2 ) the site - specific character of agroecological practices required to deliver expected ecosystem services."
FR2016203848,"We also show that an adaptive - management approach , focusing on planning and monitoring , can serve as a framework for developing and implementing learning tools tailored for biodiversity - based agriculture."
FR2016203848,"Among the current learning tools developed by researchers , we identify two main types of emergent support tools likely to help design diversified farming systems and landscapes : ( 1 ) knowledge bases containing scientific supports and experiential knowledge and ( 2 ) model - based games."
FR2016203848,These tools have to be coupled with well - tailored field or management indicators that allow monitoring effects of practices on biodiversity and ecosystem services.
FR2016203848,"Finally , we propose a research agenda that requires bringing together contributions from agricultural , ecological , management , and knowledge management sciences , and asserts that researchers have to take the position of "" integration and implementation sciences ."""
FR2016204142,Conventional crop protection with pesticides has limitations such as resistance of pests to pesticides and faunal imbalance.
FR2016204142,Agroecological crop protection is an attractive alternative based on the principles of agroecology.
FR2016204142,"We present here this strategy using the case of Cucurbitaceae flies , which are the most important agricultural pests in R , union."
FR2016204142,Research has been carried out on the bioecology of these insects and on the effectiveness of agroecological techniques.
FR2016204142,The main points are the following : the number of species of vegetable flies increased in the southern summer.
FR2016204142,"Adult flies spend more than 90 % of their time on nonhost plants , with specific circadian rhythms."
FR2016204142,"Several original agroecological techniques were designed , such as sanitation using augmentoria ; trap plants , e.g. , maize ; adulticide bait ; and the creation of habitats for predatory arthropods."
FR2016204142,Local growers are very satisfied with the results.
FR2016204142,They have reduced insecticide use with substantial cost savings and they have observed a decrease in losses and a lower phytosanitary workload.
FR2016204142,"The education and training of students , professionals , and the general public has been a major aspect of this project."
FR2016204142,Increased knowledge of flies and agroecological management strategies of their populations can now be combined with modeling tools to facilitate the extension of the program to other areas or for educational purposes.
FR2016204142,Practices are currently being extended to other areas of the island and other countries of the Indian Ocean.
FR2016204142,"This project is both a significant milestone for organic farming in R , union and a precedent for other initiatives aimed at reducing or eliminating pesticides."

RU2016001453,"The aim of the investigation was to evaluate the content of trace elements ( Zn , Cu , Co , Mo , Mn , B ) with respect to agro-ecology in arable lands of the Central Black Earth region by the example of Belgorod region."
RU2016001453,Data obtained in 1990 - 2014 were generalized.
RU2016001453,The work was carried out on the basis of the total agrochemical survey of arable lands and the local agro-ecological monitoring.
RU2016001453,"According to the results of agrochemical survey 99.2 % of soils were pertained to the category of soils , which were low provided with mobile forms of zinc in the arable layer ; for copper , cobalt and manganese these shares were 96.9 , 94.1 and 54.4 % , respectively."
RU2016001453,During the process of the local monitoring the high provision of soils from all reference plots with mobile forms of boron and low supply of 70 % of soils by mobile forms of molybdenum were revealed.
RU2016001453,The inverse relation of the mean force ( r = -0.63 ) between the average weighted content of mobile forms of zinc in districts of Belgorod regions and soil acidity was determined.
RU2016001453,"The content of mobile forms of copper , cobalt and manganese practically does not correlate with the value of this index ( r less than 0.3 )."
RU2016001453,"On the basis of the analysis of microelement composition of organic fertilizers ( cattle manure , straw - dung compost , liquid manure ) , defecation residues , used as an ameliorant for acid soils , and mineral fertilizers , taking into account the volumes of their use in the region , it was established , that the main source of trace elements for agrocoenosis is organic fertilizers."

FR2016204802,"The use of biophysical models in agroecology has increased in the last few decades for two main reasons : the need to formalize empirical knowledge and the need to disseminate model - based decision support for decision makers ( such as farmers , advisors , and policy makers )."
FR2016204802,"The first has encouraged the development and use of mathematical models to enhance the efficiency of field research through extrapolation beyond the limits of site , season , and management."
FR2016204802,"The second reflects the increasing need ( by scientists , managers , and the public ) for simulation experimentation to explore options and consequences , for example , future resource use efficiency ( i.e. , manage - ment in sustainable intensification ) , impacts of and adaptation to climate change , understanding market and policy responses to shocks initiated at a biophysical level under increasing demand , and limited supply capacity."
FR2016204802,"Production concerns thus dominate most model applications , but thereis a notable growing emphasis on environmental , economic , and policy dimensions."
FR2016204802,"Identifying effective methods of assessing model quality and performance has become a challenging but vital imperative , considering the variety of factors influencing model outputs."
FR2016204802,"Understanding the requirements of stakeholders , in respect of model use , logically implies the need for their inclusion in model evaluation methods."
FR2016204802,"We reviewed the use of metrics ofmodel evaluation , with a particular emphasis on the involvement of stakeholders to expand horizons beyond con - ventional structured , numeric analyses."
FR2016204802,"Two major topics are discussed : ( 1 ) the importance of deliberative processes for model evaluation , and ( 2 ) the role computer - aided techniques may play to integrate deliberative processes into the evaluation of agroecological models."
FR2016204802,"We point out that ( i ) the evaluation of agroecological models can be improved through stakeholder follow - up , which is a key for the acceptability of model realizations in practice , ( ii ) model credibility depends not only on the outcomes of well - structured , numerically based evaluation , but also on less tangible factors that may need to be addressed using comple - mentary deliberative processes , ( iii ) comprehensive evaluation of simulation models can be achieved by integrating the expectations of stakeholders via a weighting system of preferences and perception , ( iv ) questionnaire - based surveys can help understand the challenges posed by the delibera - tive process , and ( v ) a benefit can be obtained if model evaluation is conceived in a decisional perspective andevaluation techniques are developed at the same pace with which the models themselves are created and improved."

FR2016201118,Soils are living environments in which particularly abundant and diverse microbiome and fauna are evolving.
FR2016201118,The resulting biological functioning has a direct impact not only on soil fertility but also on a series of ecosystems services.
FR2016201118,"Thus , microbial communities are involved in geochemical cycles in which microbial enzymes catalyse the different steps."
FR2016201118,Modulation of the corresponding activities is essential as these affect plant growth and environmental quality.
FR2016201118,"In general , biodiversity affects both the productivity and stability of agroecosystems."
FR2016201118,It is therefore of paramount importance to take soil biodiversity and biological functioning into account when designing cropping systems and evaluating their impacts.
FR2016201118,"The progress achieved in soil microbiology in recent years now makes it possible to propose analyses of soil biology , as has been feasible for many years for soil physicochemistry."
FR2016201118,"These analyses obviously require the use of standardized procedures for soil sampling , measuring the abundance and diversity of the microbial communities , as well as the identification of bioindicators."
FR2016201118,"Similarly , referential systems need to be established to interpret these analyses and diagnose the biological status of soils , and , more especially , to determine whether the obtained values are within the range of variations normal for a given soil type and land use."
FR2016201118,Great progress to standardize such procedures and establish referential systems has been achieved during large - scale research programmes carried out to characterize biodiversity on national and European scales.
FR2016201118,These diagnostic elements need to be accompanied by recommendations.

FR2016217964,Context Landscape spatio - temporal heterogeneity is regarded as an important driver of biodiversity.
FR2016217964,"In agricultural landscapes , the composition and configuration of cultivated fields and their multi-year dynamics should be considered."
FR2016217964,But the habitat - matrix paradigm in landscape ecology has resulted in little consideration of cropped areas.
FR2016217964,Objectives The main objective of our study was to determine the influences of spatial and multi-year temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic on carabid beetle assemblages of agricultural landscapes.
FR2016217964,"Methods Carabids were sampled in 40 cereal fields in western France , and their species richness , total abundance and abundance of species groups with different dispersal abilities were measured."
FR2016217964,"For each sampling site , we computed different metrics that characterized crop mosaic spatial and temporal heterogeneity."
FR2016217964,We quantified relationships between carabid assemblages and heterogeneity metrics and tested their significance.
FR2016217964,Results Total carabid abundance increased with increase in temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic.
FR2016217964,"However , all species were not influenced in the same way by spatial and temporal heterogeneity metrics."
FR2016217964,"Some species with high dispersal power such as Trechus quadristriatus were more abundant in landscapes with high spatial heterogeneity , whereas the abundance of less mobile species such as Poecilus cupreus were only positively influenced by temporal crop dynamics."
FR2016217964,"Conclusion Our results suggest thatboth the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic affects farmland biodiversity , at least for species that use crops during their life cycle or disperse through fields."
FR2016217964,We highlight the importance of taking this heterogeneity into account in further ecological studies on biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.
LV2016024350,"Serpentine ( i.e. ultramafic ) outcrops in Europe cover more than 10,000 km2 and have a low - fertility and low - productivity , making them unattractive for traditional agriculture."
LV2016024350,"In general , these areas are slowly abandoned by local farmers , affected by strong rural exodus and landscapes undergo a process of closure."
LV2016024350,"However , ultramafic landscapes have the potential to provide multiple ecosystem services that can contribute to Europeâ € ™ s goals towards insuring food security , production of renewable raw materials and renewable energy."
LV2016024350,"Phytomining ( Agromining ) aims at cultivating metal hyperaccumulator plants that are able to accumulate Ni and other strategic elements from metal - rich soils and transport them to the shoots ( > 1 % ) , which can then be harvested as a bio-ore."
LV2016024350,"Such metal - rich biomass can be used to recover highly valuable metals , e.g. nickel ( Ni ) and also to produce energy ( heat , electricity )."
LV2016024350,Nickel agromining can thus offer an eco-efficient alternative to classical pyro - or hydrometallurgical processes without disturbing the soil cover and the geology from soils and rocks that would be considered as low grade ores or sterile material for conventional mining methods.
LV2016024350,"Phytomining agroecosystems can lead to better soil resource efficiency and can offer a fully integrated , new agromining agriculture that could cover thousands of km2 in Europe , benefit local communities with a sustainable rural development and provide a wide array of ecosystem services which will need to be optimised under a Life Cycle Assessment methodology : 1."

RS2018001330,Seed health testing of fifteen soybean cultivars obtained from five locations in the Guinea Savannah agro-ecology of Nigeria was carried out using two main seed health testing methods described by the International Seed Testing Association ( ISTA ) ; the standard blotter and two variants of agar plate incubation method ( Potato Dextrose Agar and Czapeck Dox Agar plate methods ) to determine the seed infection by fungi.
RS2018001330,Seed component plating was also carried out to determine the most active site of infection of the seeds by the fungi.
RS2018001330,Five fungal species were isolated from the cultivars tested.

AU2019D04045,Water scarcity contributes to the poverty of around one - third of the world 's people.
AU2019D04045,"Despite many benefits , tree planting in dry regions is often discouraged by concerns that trees reduce water availability."
AU2019D04045,"Yet relevant studies from the tropics are scarce , and the impacts of intermediate tree cover remain unexplored."
AU2019D04045,We developed and tested an optimum tree cover theory in which groundwater recharge is maximized at an intermediate tree density.
AU2019D04045,"Below this optimal tree density the benefits from any additional trees on water percolation exceed their extra water use , leading to increased groundwater recharge , while above the optimum the opposite occurs."
AU2019D04045,"Our results , based on groundwater budgets calibrated with measurements of drainage and transpiration in a cultivated woodland in West Africa , demonstrate that groundwater recharge was maximised at intermediate tree densities."
AU2019D04045,"In contrast to the prevailing view , we therefore find that moderate tree cover can increase groundwater recharge , and that tree planting and various tree management options can improve groundwater resources."
AU2019D04045,"We evaluate the necessary conditions for these results to hold and suggest that they are likely to be common in the seasonally dry tropics , offering potential for widespread tree establishment and increased benefits for hundreds of millions of people."
QC2018600415,Agroecology can provide a framework to ensure the sustainability of farming systems in regard to environmental issues of agriculture.

QC2018600415,"Based on a participatory approach , we organised focus - groups on self - sufficiency definition and agro-environmental performances."
QC2018600415,We carried on 20 farmersâ € ™ interview to collect data about practices and environmental features.
QC2018600415,Four self - sufficiency patterns were identi - fied and a set of 20 indicators which addressed agronomical and environmental features was built.
QC2018600415,Feed self - sufficiency is different for each pattern.
QC2018600415,The main differences of environmental impacts ( based on input use ) are linked to the Organic pattern.
QC2018600415,The use of wide diversity of meadows and species increases the concentrate suf - ficiency.

AJ2018000153,"A cross-sectional study was conducted from June , 2013 to October , 2014 to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of clinical bovine dermatophilosis in dairy cattle in selected districttowns of West Shewa Zone."
AJ2018000153,A total of 816 dairy cattle from 60 dairy farms were clinically examined for skin lesion followed by microscopic examination of skin scrapings.
AJ2018000153,"The overall individual animal and herd level prevalence of clinical dermatophilosis were 5.0 % and 18.3 % , respectively."
AJ2018000153,"Agro-ecology , management system,ecto - parasite infestations were risk factors significantly associated with its occurrence."
AJ2018000153,"Consequently , the prevalence was significantly higher in cattle in mid land altitude than cattle in highlands ; in cattle under semi-intensive than in intensive management system and in ecto - parasite infested than non-infested ones."
AJ2018000153,"However , other studied variables such as herd size , age , sex and breed did not show significant associations ( p < 0.05 ) with the disease."
AJ2018000153,These findings indicate the interactions of the risk factors for the occurrence of clinical dermatophilosis in the study area.
AJ2018000153,"Consequently , clinical dermatophilosis might have adverse effects on production and productivity of dairy cattle."
AJ2018000153,"Therefore , good husbandary practices such as control of ecto - parasite and proper therapeutic intervention are of paramount importance for control of clinical bovine dermatophilosis and to reduce lossess associated to the disease.Keywords : Clinical dermatophilos is ; Dairy cattle ; Prevalence ; Riskfactors"
FR2018100140,Agro-ecological innovations aim at promoting sustainable agricultural practices that have long term benefits.
FR2018100140,"However , farmers rarely adopt beneficial innovations in agro-ecology despite expressing an understanding of the benefits and a desire to do so."
FR2018100140,It has been argued that the farmers lack sufficient knowledge to implement complex innovations.
FR2018100140,"We believe that in many cases such knowledge is necessary , but is ultimately insufficient for complex innovation adoption."
FR2018100140,"We argue that in addition to knowledge and a desire to adopt an innovation , many farmers require a collaborative relation with an ally."
FR2018100140,We call this method the Alliance Approach to innovation.
FR2018100140,This approach is modeled after the therapeutic Alliance Approach at work in cognitive and behavioral sciences.
FR2018100140,"We argue that using the Alliance Approach will not only prove effective in helping farmers adopt complex agro-ecology innovations , but also a better fit for the human centered development of capability approach human development , as it is likely to enhance both the well - being and agency of the farmers."

FR2018100501,CSA has given rise to a lively debate in both the scientific community and civil society although it addresses the pressing need for an efficient strategy to manage agriculture and food systems facing climate change ( CC ).
FR2018100501,"CSA formally targets the simultaneous fulfilment of three criteria : ( i ) CC mitigation , ( ii ) adaptation to CC and ( iii ) food security."
FR2018100501,"Yet , the review of scientific literature on CSA displays a clear discrepancy between these three objectives , underlining the fact that CSA is regularly perceived as addressing only adaptation , and not mitigation and food security."
FR2018100501,"On the other hand , research on agroecology ( AE ) reveals an extensive knowledge about food security and adaptation , often at scales which can be considered complementary to those of CSA."
FR2018100501,"A better use by CSA of AE research results may help CSA focus on two currently overlooked dimensions , i.e. ( i ) mitigation and ( ii ) trade - offs and synergies between the three criteria."
FR2018100501,"CSA does not have a specific blueprint for climate - smart practices and has rather a strong focus on policies , institutions and financing."
FR2018100501,Hence AE actually responds to the needs of CSA in terms of site - specificity and potential for adoption by farmers because it is strongly based on local practices.
FR2018100501,We argue that an eco - and socio - logical approach to CSA represents a sine qua non condition if CSA is to promote inclusive development and participate to collective efforts to manage agriculture and food systems under climate change.

XF2018001404,Good agroecological practices are indispensable for the development of sustainable agriculture.
XF2018001404,"In this book , principles , diversity and applications of agroecological practices for a range of systems are presented , transforming scientific research and participatory knowledge of production into practical application."
XF2018001404,It illustrates a broad range of research and teaching being used within the farming community to demonstrate best practice and current state - of - play within the field.
XF2018001404,"Agroecological methods used in crop farming , grass - based livestock farming , fish production , and other complex farming systems are discussed."
XF2018001404,Conclusions are drawn from studies to provide an outlook on future trends of agroecological practices and on policies supporting implementation.
XF2018001404,"Due to emphasis on real - life application , it is relevant not only to students of the agricultural sciences and public policy , but also to researchers , stakeholders and policy makers involved in the development of sustainable agriculture."
XF2018001270,"Our global food system is largely based on unsustainable industrial agricultural practices , is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions , is controlled by a handful of large corporations and produces unhealthy food."
XF2018001270,Agroecology is a solution to these increasingly urgent problems.
XF2018001270,"After decades of being dismissed by mainstream institutions and defended in obscurity by grassroots movements , some scientists and farmers , agroecology is suddenly in fashion."
XF2018001270,"The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization , government agencies and even corporations are jumping on the bandwagon."
XF2018001270,"But , are they for the same agroecology as developed by pioneering farmers , scientists and peasant social movements , or are they seeking to co-opt the concept and give it different content?"
XF2018001270,"Rosset and Altieri , two of the worldâ € ™ s leading agroecologists , outline the principles , history and currents of agroecological thought , the scientific evidence for agroecology , how to bring agroecology to scale and the contemporary politics of agroecology."
AU2019D04900,The neglect and marginalisation of smallholders in economic and development policy contributes to increasing vulnerability of rural communities.
AU2019D04900,"Underinvestment in agriculture , climate change impacts and growing competition for land and water places further pressure on smallholders."
AU2019D04900,"In this context , this paper examines the current focus in the South Pacific on strengthening the linkages between tourism and agriculture through agritourism."
AU2019D04900,"The paper seeks to merge multiple discourses , by firstly reviewing the development model that is driving tourism and linkages to agriculture in the South Pacific."
AU2019D04900,"Secondly , agritourism as it is conceptualised in the tourism literature and thirdly sustainable tourism discourse , to identify economic activities within agritourism that contribute to enhancing smallholdersâ € ™ livelihoods in the South Pacific."
AU2019D04900,An ecologically and socially inclusive model of agritourism is put forward based on principles of sustainable tourism and agroecology referred to as agroecological tourism.
AU2019D04900,Agroecological tourism strengthens the linkages between tourism and agriculture while fostering sustainability principles.
US2018H01488,Background : Molecular characterization is important for efficient utilization of germplasm and development of improved varieties.
US2018H01488,"In the present study , we investigated the genetic purity , relatedness and population structure of 265 maize inbred lines from the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research ( EIAR ) , the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre ( CIMMYT ) and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture ( IITA ) using 220,878 single nucleotide polymorphic ( SNP ) markers obtained using genotyping by sequencing ( GBS )."
US2018H01488,"Results : Only 22 % of the inbred lines were considered pure with < 5 % heterogeneity , while the remaining 78 % of the inbred lines had a heterogeneity ranging from 5.1 to 31.5 %."
US2018H01488,"Pairwise genetic distances among the 265 inbred lines varied from 0.011 to 0.345 , with 89 % of the pairs falling between 0.301 and 0.345."
US2018H01488,"Only < 1 % of the pairs had a genetic distance lower than 0.200 , which included 14 pairs of sister lines that were nearly identical."
US2018H01488,"Relative kinship analysis showed that the kinship coefficients for 59 % of the pairs of lines was close to zero , which agrees with the genetic distance estimates."
US2018H01488,"Principal coordinate analysis , discriminant analysis of principal components ( DAPC ) and the modelbased population structure analysis consistently suggested the presence of three groups , which generally agreed with pedigree information ( genetic background )."
US2018H01488,"Although not distinct enough , the SNP markers showed some level of separation between the two CIMMYT heterotic groups A and B established based on pedigree and combining ability information.Conclusions : The high level of heterogeneity detected in most of the inbred lines suggested the requirement for purification or further inbreeding except those deliberately maintained at early inbreeding level."
US2018H01488,The genetic distance and relative kinship analysis clearly indicated the uniqueness of most of the inbred lines in the maize germplasm available for breeders in the mid-altitude maize breeding program of Ethiopia.
US2018H01488,Results from the present study facilitate the maize breeding work in Ethiopia and germplasm exchange among breeding programs in Africa.
US2018H01488,We suggest the incorporation of high density molecular marker information in future heterotic group assignments.
RU2018P00282,"in this paper I present an overview of how scientists in agriculture perceived the soils that produce the crops , and then I try to find out how these perceptions are â € “ more or less consciously â € “ included in agronomy and various related disciplines."
RU2018P00282,In microbiology the notion of complex soil ecosystems came up in the nineteenth century.
RU2018P00282,"Conversion of crop remnants and manure on the one hand and feeding the crops on the other hand were studied as a balance in time ( seasons ) , of manuring , crop rotation and ( minimal ) tillage in mixed systems."
RU2018P00282,Therein crop â € “ and livestock production were managed to be in balance.
RU2018P00282,But that notion and its experience of â € ˜living soilsâ € ™ were overruled by an upcoming use of the external inputs of agrochemicals â € “ fertilisers and subsequently pesticides â € “ after World War II.
RU2018P00282,"However , minimalized in the sideline , soil - friendly agriculture survived in organic and biodynamic movements , in this century enhanced by various similar approaches like agro-ecology."
RU2018P00282,"And then the FAO declared the year 2015 as the year of the soil , as the chemical agriculture they had supported for decades , had appeared to be shockingly soil - destructive : causing soilerosion and subsequently flooding followed by drought."
RU2018P00282,"Furthermore I present the soil - ecosystem awareness of today in various disciplines such as plant breeding , biosphere & climate , human health , rural development , manuring , phytopathology ( including pesticide effects in soil ecosystems )."
RS2019001259,The purpose of this paper is to analyse the introduction of certain plant species such as pot marigolds ( Calendula officinalis L. ) into neglected and predominantly urban spaces in the Republic of Serbia.
RS2019001259,The research was based on the results obtained in a two - year experiment conducted in the vicinity of the Novi Sad - Backa Palanka road.
RS2019001259,"The primary objective of the experiment was to examine the behaviour of pot marigolds in poor - quality and neglected soils , with minimum cultural practices , in order to obtain novel plants in such adverse environments , which could be subsequently marketed in Serbia."
RS2019001259,The experiment commenced in 2014 by planting pot marigolds in plots previously cleared of weeds by mechanical tilling.
RS2019001259,"In the spring of 2015 , pot marigold seedlings , i.e. the first generation of plants obtained from the plots created in 2014 , were planted in weed - free plots."
RS2019001259,"The measurements were performed in three replicates from 10 October to 10 December 2015 in order to determine the number of volunteer plants , which could be further improved in nursery production and subsequently marketed in Serbia."
RS2019001259,"The results obtained indubitably indicate that this and prospective studies exert positive ecological , agricultural and economic effects on a vast range of potential users."

KR2018000483,The global rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration and its associated climate change have significant effects on agricultural productivity and hydrological cycle.
KR2018000483,"For food security and agricultural water resources planning , it is critical to investigate the impact of climate change on changes in agricultural productivity and water consumption."
KR2018000483,"APEX - Paddy model , which is the modified version of APEX ( Agricultural Policy / Environmental eXtender ) model for paddy ecosystem , was used to evaluate rice productivity and evapotranspiration based on climate change scenario."
KR2018000483,"Two study areas ( Gimjae , Icheon ) were selected and the input dataset was obtained from the literature."
KR2018000483,RCP ( Representitive Concentration Pathways ) based climate change scenarios were provided by KMA ( Korean Meteorological Administration ).
KR2018000483,Rice yield data from 1997 to 2015 were used to validate APEX - Paddy model.
KR2018000483,"The effects of climate change were evaluated at a 30 - year interval , such as the 1990s ( historical , 1976 ~ 2005 ) , the 2025s ( 2011 ~ 2040 ) , the 2055s ( 2041 ~ 2070 ) , and the 2085s ( 2071 ~ 2100 )."
KR2018000483,Climate change scenarios showed that the overall evapotranspiration in the 2085s reduced from 10.5 % to 16.3 %.
KR2018000483,"The evaporations were reduced from 15.6 % to 21.7 % due to shortend growth period , the transpirations were reduced from 0.0 % to 24.2 % due to increased CO2 concentration and shortend growth period."
KR2018000483,"In case of rice yield , in the 2085s were reduced from 6.0 % to 25.0 % compared with the ones in the 1990s."
KR2018000483,The findings of this study would play a significant role as the basics for evaluating the vulnerability of paddy rice productivity and water management plan against climate change.
XF2018000945,The FAO - ICARDA International Technical Cooperation Network on Cactus ( CactusNet ) was established in 1993 to support the promotion of this underutilized crop.
XF2018000945,"The first edition of this book , Agro-ecology , cultivation and uses of cactus pear , was published in 1995."
XF2018000945,"During the last 20 years much knowledge on cactus pear has been generated , and this is reflected in this extensively revised edition in 2017."
XF2018001188,"Agroecology is our best option for creating an agrifood system capable of nurturing people , societies , and the planet."
XF2018001188,But it is still not widespread.
XF2018001188,"Fertile Ground offers nine case studies , authored by agroecologists from Africa , Latin America , the Caribbean , North America , and Europe , that demonstrate how the endogenous practice of agroecology can be â € œscaledâ € so that it is known by more farmers , practiced more deeply , and integrated in planning and policy."
AU2019D00007,Smallholder farmers continue to make up the largest proportion of the world 's disadvantaged.
AU2019D00007,"Rural smallholders in the South Pacific are particularly vulnerable to climate change , underinvestment and growing competition for land and resources."
AU2019D00007,"Strengthening synergies between agriculture and tourism through avenues such as agritourism has been widely discussed ; however , very little research has approached these concepts from a sustainability perspective."
AU2019D00007,This case study of rural Ni - Vanuatu smallholders uses the Agroecology and Sustainable Rural Livelihoods Framework ( ASRLF ) to explore tourism 's potential contribution to improved conservation and food security outcomes.
AU2019D00007,Data collection combined participatory methods such as â € œstorian sessionsâ € with analysis of secondary data.The findings highlight minimal current opportunities for rural Ni - Vanuatu smallholders to gain significantly from the tourism sector in Vanuatu.
AU2019D00007,The shift from traditional gardening systems to cash cropping monocultures is also conflicting with tourism and conservation goals.
AU2019D00007,"This paper puts forward agroecological tourism as a strategy for integrating positive conservation , food security and livelihood outcomes for rural smallholders."
AU2019D00007,It defines agroecological tourism as having a primary focus on the interpretation of sustainable traditional agroecosystems which exhibit cultural and heritage significance.
AU2019D00007,"Agroecological tourism has potential to support traditional practices , enhance the preservation of cultural knowledge and promote sustainable farming practices."
XF2018001355,Todayâ € ™ s food and agricultural systems have succeeded in supplying large volumes of food to global markets.
XF2018001355,"However , high - external input , resource - intensive agricultural systems have caused massive deforestation , water scarcities , biodiversity loss , soil depletion and high levels of greenhouse gas emissions."
XF2018001355,"Despite significant progress in recent times , hunger and extreme poverty persist as critical global challenges."
XF2018001355,"Even where poverty has been reduced , pervasive inequalities remain , hindering poverty eradication."
XF2018001355,"Integral to FAOâ € ™ s Common Vision for Sustainable Food and Agriculture , agroecology is a key part of the global response to this climate of instability , offering a unique approach to meeting significant increases in our food needs of the future while ensuring no one is left behind."
XF2018001355,Agroecology is an integrated approach that simultaneously applies ecological and social concepts and principles to the design and management of food and agricultural systems.
XF2018001355,"It seeks to optimize the interactions between plants , animals , humans and the environment while taking into consideration the social aspects that need to be addressed for a sustainable and fair food system."
XF2018001355,Agroecology is not a new invention.
XF2018001355,"It can be identified in scientific literature since the 1920s , and has found expression in family farmersâ € ™ practices , in grassroots social movements for sustainability and the public policies of various countries around the world."
XF2018001355,"More recently , agroecology has entered the discourse of international and UN institutions."

FR2019185874,"It took place in Siem Reap , Cambodia , on 6th â € “ 8th of November 2018."
FR2019185874,"It has been the biggest event on agroecology in the Mekong Region since the Regional Symposium organized by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) in November 2015 , in Bangkok , Thailand."
FR2019185874,Over 260 participants from 21 nationalities gathered to discuss the futures of Agroecology during an unprecedented Regional Forum.
FR2019185874,"The event was co-organized by the General Directorate of Agriculture ( GDA ) of Cambodia , CIRAD and GRET in a joint effort to promote agroecology."
FR2019185874,"The overall aim of the forum was to build a momentum around the different dimensions of Agroecology that should be addressed , and consolidate a Regional Agroecology stakeholders ' coalition by wrapping up the achievements of ACTAE project ( Towards an Agroecological Transition in South - East Asia , AFD ) and discussing the future of regional initiative in Agroecology."
FR2019185874,"Over 3 days , the participants could learn , share and network through 74 presentations in plenary and parallel sessions , an innovation and knowledge fair ( with over 20 booths ) , a poster session ( 25 were presented ) and a seed swap where more than 60 different plant species were exchanged."
FR2019185874,"Agroecology being diverse and multidimensional , a broad range of issues were addressed such as the fundamental role of crop biodiversity , the highly preoccupying status of agrochemical use in the region , the need for appropriate - scale mechanization , the importance of innovative and participatory intervention mechanisms , the recognition and integration of Indigenous Knowledge , the capacity building of the new generation , the marketing of agroecological productsâ € ¦ A panel discussion bringing together representatives from AFD , the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , the Livelihood Trust Fund ( LIFT ) , the International Fund for Agriculture Development ( IFAD ) and the French Embassy highlighted the existing different initiatives for supporting an agroecological transition."
FR2019185874,"Three main take home messages emerged from all the discussions : â € “ The importance to invest in soil health and farmer empowerment , â € “ The necessity to seek convergence between land tenure & agroecology and co-produce a credible narrative for a smallholder pathway towards agricultural development , â € “ The challenge posed by commodities - based production systems to an agroecological transition."
FR2019185874,"Lastly , in order to put into practice agroecology , this event was organized in the greener way as possible , choosing an eco-responsible venue , sourcing its coffee and fruits from local organic farms and banning the use of plastic bottles."

XF2018001258,"This book argues that sustainable development , based on sustained growth , has led us to an impasse."
XF2018001258,"In response , Agroecology brings back and utilises notions of eco-development and co-evolution with nature as a refreshing paradigm."
XF2018001258,"It also proposes a further shift in mindset with the notion of being within , or looking at agroecology as a way to reconnect and rebuild relationships and movement within farming systems and beyond."
XF2018001258,"Rather than linear technical fixes , it considers the critical nodes of tension , the inflection points , or acupoints , which can trigger a transition towards greater harmony and well - being."
XF2018001258,"The book also draws from a concrete example of agroecology by examining a pilot project in Mozambique testing new approaches to investments and peasant farming that will inspire farming communities , researchers , policy makers and development organizations alike , to build greater autonomy and self - determination."
