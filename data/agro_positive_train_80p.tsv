GB2013202653	The paper points out that supporters of Ecoagriculture ( ECOAG ) adhere to two pervasive but flawed assumptions : ( a ) that alternatives to a chemically - based crop production system necessarily require more land to produce the same amount of output and ( b ) that the adverse ecological and health consequences of industrial farming are minor in comparison to those that would be wrought by expansion of land extensive production systems.ECOAG , the study argues , has a profound negative ecological and health and social impacts : monoculture systems , lacking in functional biodiversity and self regulatory mechanisms , are genetically homogenous and species poor systems that are very vulnerable to diseases and pest outbreaksdue to this increased vulnerability a large quantity of pesticides has to be applied bringing enourmous environmental and health costsECOAG indirectly promotes the use of agrochemicals and GMOs the real causes of hunger are poverty , inequality and lack of access to food and land , and not necessarily the lack of production ; and as most methods of production intensification ( also those proposed by ECOAG ) deepen inequalities , they will fail to reduce hunger.The study concludes that without further endangering the natural environment depends upon public support for high - yield , sustainable agriculture research , education and extension.	points out	The paper	that supporters of Ecoagriculture ( ECOAG ) adhere to two pervasive but flawed assumptions	1	1

GB2013202653	The paper points out that supporters of Ecoagriculture ( ECOAG ) adhere to two pervasive but flawed assumptions : ( a ) that alternatives to a chemically - based crop production system necessarily require more land to produce the same amount of output and ( b ) that the adverse ecological and health consequences of industrial farming are minor in comparison to those that would be wrought by expansion of land extensive production systems.ECOAG , the study argues , has a profound negative ecological and health and social impacts : monoculture systems , lacking in functional biodiversity and self regulatory mechanisms , are genetically homogenous and species poor systems that are very vulnerable to diseases and pest outbreaksdue to this increased vulnerability a large quantity of pesticides has to be applied bringing enourmous environmental and health costsECOAG indirectly promotes the use of agrochemicals and GMOs the real causes of hunger are poverty , inequality and lack of access to food and land , and not necessarily the lack of production ; and as most methods of production intensification ( also those proposed by ECOAG ) deepen inequalities , they will fail to reduce hunger.The study concludes that without further endangering the natural environment depends upon public support for high - yield , sustainable agriculture research , education and extension.	to be applied	a large quantity of pesticides	bringing enourmous environmental and health costsECOAG indirectly	1	1
